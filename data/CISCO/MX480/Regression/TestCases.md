## Regression Test Cases - Network MSeries Router MX480

### Interface Connectivity Test
#### Test Case 1: Verify that all interface ports are operational and can establish connection
##### Test Steps:
1. Connect a device to each interface port on the MX480 router
2. Verify that the devices can establish a network connection
3. Check for any physical or logical link issues

#### Test Case 2: Validate the interface speed and duplex settings
##### Test Steps:
1. Access the interface configuration on the MX480 router
2. Verify that the speed and duplex settings are correctly configured for each interface
3. Ensure that the settings match the expected requirements for the network environment

### Routing and Traffic Test
#### Test Case 3: Confirm proper functioning of the routing table
##### Test Steps:
1. Review and validate the routing table entries on the MX480 router
2. Verify that the routes are correctly learned and propagated
3. Simulate traffic for different network destinations and ensure the correct path is used

#### Test Case 4: Validate traffic forwarding and load balancing
##### Test Steps:
1. Send varying traffic loads through the MX480 router
2. Monitor the traffic distribution and ensure that load balancing is performed effectively
3. Confirm that traffic is forwarded without disruption or packet loss

### Security and Access Control Test
#### Test Case 5: Test firewall and access control list (ACL) functionality
##### Test Steps:
1. Configure firewall rules and ACLs on the MX480 router
2. Attempt to access restricted resources and verify that access is denied as per the configured rules
3. Ensure that legitimate traffic is allowed based on the defined policies

```python
# Mock configuration script for firewall rules
firewall {
  filter test-filter {
    term 1 {
      from {
        source-address {
          192.168.1.0/24;
        }
      }
      then {
        discard;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Test Case 6: Check for vulnerabilities and security updates
##### Test Steps:
1. Assess the MX480's firmware for any known vulnerabilities
2. Apply the latest security updates and patches
3. Verify that the router remains operational and secure after the updates have been applied

These regression test cases cover critical areas of functioning for the Network MSeries Router MX480 and ensure that it continues to perform reliably and securely.
