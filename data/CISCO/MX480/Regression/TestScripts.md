Sure! Below is an example of how you can create a Python script for a Regression test and include data with markdown compatible for headers, sub headers, paragraphs, and code snippets.

`regression_test_1.py`
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Load the data
data = pd.read_csv('regression_data.csv')

# Split the data into features and target
X = data[['feature1', 'feature2']]
y = data['target']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Calculate the mean squared error
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)

print(f"Mean squared error: {mse}")
```

`regression_data.csv`
```csv
feature1,feature2,target
1,2,3
2,3,5
3,4,7
4,5,9
5,6,11
```

This script includes a simple linear regression model applied to some sample data. The script loads the data from a CSV file, splits it into training and testing sets, trains the model, and then evaluates its performance based on the mean squared error.

The markdown format can be used to provide explanations, headers, and sub-headers within the script file just like how it's used in ChatGPT. You can choose to keep the markdown in the Python file itself or in a separate documentation file for easy readability.
