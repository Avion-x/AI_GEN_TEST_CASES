### Unit Test Cases for Network MSeries Router MX480

#### Test Case 1: Power On Self Test (POST)
**Scenario:** 
- Verify that the MX480 router successfully completes the Power On Self Test (POST) upon start-up.

**Steps:**
1. Power on the MX480 router.
2. Monitor the console for any POST errors.
3. Record the result of the POST.

**Expected Result:**
- The router should complete the POST without any errors.

#### Test Case 2: Interface Configuration
**Scenario:**
- Validate the configuration of network interfaces on the MX480 router.

**Steps:**
1. Access the router's command line interface (CLI).
2. Review the configuration of all network interfaces.
3. Verify the correct settings for each interface (e.g., IP address, subnet mask, speed, duplex).

**Expected Result:**
- All network interfaces should have the correct configuration settings.

```bash
show interfaces terse
```

#### Test Case 3: Routing Protocol Configuration
**Scenario:**
- Ensure that the routing protocols are properly configured and operational.

**Steps:**
1. Check the current routing protocol configuration.
2. Verify the status and connectivity of the routing protocols.
3. Test the routing protocol functionality by transmitting test traffic.

**Expected Result:**
- The routing protocols should be properly configured and functioning without any issues.

```bash
show route protocol
```

#### Test Case 4: High Availability and Redundancy
**Scenario:**
- Test the high availability and redundancy features of the MX480 router.

**Steps:**
1. Simulate a failure scenario (e.g., link failure, hardware component failure).
2. Monitor the router's behavior and failover to redundant systems.
3. Ensure that traffic continues to flow without interruption during the failure.

**Expected Result:**
- The router should seamlessly failover to redundant systems and maintain high availability.

#### Test Case 5: Performance and Scalability
**Scenario:**
- Measure the performance and scalability of the MX480 router under high load.

**Steps:**
1. Generate a significant amount of network traffic through the router.
2. Monitor the router's performance metrics (e.g., CPU utilization, memory usage).
3. Ensure that the router can handle the load without degrading performance.

**Expected Result:**
- The router should maintain stable performance and scalability under high load conditions.

```bash
show system statistics
