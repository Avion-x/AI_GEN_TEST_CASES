Sure, here are some example unit test cases for the Network MSeries Router MX480:

# Unit Test Cases for Network MSeries Router MX480

## Test Case 1: Interface Connectivity

### Description:
This test case will verify if all physical interfaces on the MX480 router are properly connected and able to transmit data.

### Test Steps:
1. Connect a testing device to each physical interface on the MX480.
2. Send a test signal from the MX480 to each connected device.
3. Verify that the test signal is received by the respective device.

### Expected Output:
```
Interface ge-0/0/0: Test signal received
Interface ge-0/0/1: Test signal received
... (and so on for all interfaces)
```

## Test Case 2: OSPF Routing

### Description:
This test case will verify if the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) routing protocol is correctly functioning on the MX480 router.

### Test Steps:
1. Configure OSPF on the MX480 with a set of test network addresses and routers.
2. Verify that routes are correctly learned and propagated throughout the network.
3. Perform a failover test by shutting down a primary OSPF route and verifying that traffic is rerouted through an alternate path.

### Expected Output:
```
OSPF routes learned: 10
OSPF route failover successful
```

## Test Case 3: Traffic Filtering

### Description:
This test case will verify if traffic filtering rules are being properly enforced on the MX480 router.

### Test Steps:
1. Configure a set of traffic filtering rules on the MX480 for a specific subnet.
2. Simulate incoming traffic that violates the filtering rules.
3. Verify that the MX480 drops or filters the simulated traffic according to the configured rules.

### Expected Output:
```
Simulated traffic dropped: Yes
```

These are just a few examples of unit test cases for the Network MSeries Router MX480. The actual test cases may vary depending on the specific features and configurations being tested.
