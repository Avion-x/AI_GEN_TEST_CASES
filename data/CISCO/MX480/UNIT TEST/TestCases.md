### Unit Test Cases for Network M-Series Router MX480

#### Test Case 1: Checking Initial Configuration
1. **Objective:** To ensure the router is initialized with default settings.
2. **Input:** No input required.
3. **Expected output:** Successful boot-up with default configuration and no error messages.

#### Test Case 2: Interface Connectivity Test
1. **Objective:** To verify the connectivity of all physical interfaces.
2. **Input:** Test connection through each physical interface (ge-0/0/0, ge-0/0/1, etc.).
3. **Expected output:** Successful connection with no packet loss and expected interface status.

#### Test Case 3: Routing Protocol Configuration Test
1. **Objective:** To check if the routing protocols are properly configured and functioning.
2. **Input:** Review and validate the routing protocol (e.g., OSPF, BGP) configuration.
3. **Expected output:** Successful establishment of neighbor relationships and routing table population.

#### Test Case 4: Firewall and Security Test
1. **Objective:** To ensure that firewall policies are correctly applied and security measures are functional.
2. **Input:** Test different types of traffic (e.g., HTTP, SSH) to verify the firewall policies.
3. **Expected output:** Proper traffic filtering as per configured policies.

#### Test Case 5: Performance and Load Testing
1. **Objective:** Validate the router's performance under high load conditions.
2. **Input:** Generate high traffic over multiple interfaces and monitor the router's performance.
3. **Expected output:** The router should maintain stable performance and not exhibit high resource utilization.
