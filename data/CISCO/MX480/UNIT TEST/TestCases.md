# Unit Test Cases for Network MSeries Router MX480

## Configuration Management
- **Test Case 1:** Verify that the router's configuration can be retrieved without errors.
  - **Input:** N/A
  - **Expected Output:** Success message or configuration data

- **Test Case 2:** Verify that changes can be made to the router's configuration without errors.
  - **Input:** Updated configuration data
  - **Expected Output:** Success message or confirmation of changes

## Security
- **Test Case 3:** Ensure that the router's firewall is functioning properly.
  - **Input:** Test traffic
  - **Expected Output:** No unauthorized access or successful blocking of unauthorized access

- **Test Case 4:** Verify that security policies are enforced correctly.
  - **Input:** Test policy violation attempt
  - **Expected Output:** Policy enforcement message or blocked access

## Routing and Switching
- **Test Case 5:** Validate routing functionality for different types of traffic (e.g., IPv4, IPv6, multicast).
  - **Input:** Various types of traffic
  - **Expected Output:** Successful routing and delivery of traffic to the correct destination

- **Test Case 6:** Ensure that switching operations work as expected for different VLANs.
  - **Input:** Traffic with different VLAN tags
  - **Expected Output:** Proper switching and segregation of traffic based on VLAN tags

## Performance
- **Test Case 7:** Measure the throughput and latency of the router under high traffic load.
  - **Input:** High volume of test traffic
  - **Expected Output:** Throughput and latency measurements within acceptable limits

- **Test Case 8:** Test redundancy and failover mechanisms.
  - **Input:** Simulated failure scenarios
  - **Expected Output:** Smooth failover and continued operation with minimal disruption
