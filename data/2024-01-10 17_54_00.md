# UNIT TEST CASES for Network MSeries Router MX480

## 1. Testing Router Configuration

### Test Case 1: Validate Default Configuration
- **Description:** Verify that the default configuration of the router is correctly set up.
- **Steps:**
  1. Connect to the router using the console port.
  2. Log in to the router using default credentials.
  3. Check the configuration parameters such as interfaces, routing protocols, and security settings.

### Test Case 2: Interface Configuration
- **Description:** Test the configuration of various interfaces on the router.
- **Steps:**
  1. Configure a new interface with proper IP addressing and VLAN settings.
  2. Verify that the interface is up and functioning as expected.
  3. Test different types of interfaces including Ethernet, SONET, and ATM.

## 2. Performance Testing

### Test Case 3: Throughput Testing
- **Description:** Measure the maximum throughput of the router under load.
- **Steps:**
  1. Generate a high volume of traffic through the router using a traffic generator tool.
  2. Monitor the router's performance using SNMP or other monitoring tools.
  3. Compare the observed throughput with the specifications provided by the manufacturer.

### Test Case 4: Latency Testing
- **Description:** Measure the latency of packets passing through the router.
- **Steps:**
  1. Send packets with known timestamps through the router.
  2. Measure the time taken for the packets to reach their destination.
  3. Calculate the average and maximum latency and compare with expected values.

## 3. Security Testing

### Test Case 5: Access Control
- **Description:** Test the access control features of the router.
- **Steps:**
  1. Attempt to access the router using incorrect credentials.
  2. Verify that access is denied and appropriate error messages are displayed.
  3. Test different access control lists and verify that they are effective in controlling traffic.

### Test Case 6: Firewall Functionality
- **Description:** Verify the functionality of the router's firewall features.
- **Steps:**
  1. Configure and apply firewall rules to restrict or allow specific types of traffic.
  2. Send test traffic through the router and verify that the firewall rules are being enforced.
  3. Verify that logging and alerting features are working as expected.

```python
# Example Python code snippet for testing firewall functionality
def test_firewall_functionality():
    # Configure firewall rules
    router.configure_firewall_rules(rules)
    
    # Send test traffic
    test_traffic = generate_test_traffic()
    
    # Verify firewall enforcement
    assert router.is_traffic_allowed(test_traffic) == expected_result
```
