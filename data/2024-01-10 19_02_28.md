# Network MX480 Router - Unit Test Cases

## Test Case 1: 
### Test Name: Interfaces Configuration
#### Test Description: Verify the correct configuration and functionality of all interfaces on the router.
```bash
1. Check if all physical interfaces are up and running
2. Verify that the logical interfaces are correctly mapped to physical ports
3. Test the ability to set up and tear down interfaces
4. Ensure that VLAN configuration is correctly applied to interfaces
```

## Test Case 2:
### Test Name: Routing Protocols
#### Test Description: Validate the operation of routing protocols on the router.
```bash
1. Test the functionality of OSPF, BGP, and MPLS protocols
2. Verify the correct propagation of routing updates and advertisements
3. Check the convergence time of routing tables after a network change
4. Validate the implementation of route redistribution and filtering
```

## Test Case 3:
### Test Name: Security Features
#### Test Description: Ensure the proper functioning of security features on the router.
```bash
1. Verify the operation of firewall and access control lists (ACLs)
2. Test the functionality of IPsec and SSL VPNs
3. Validate the ability to detect and mitigate DDoS attacks
4. Ensure that security policies and rules are correctly enforced
```

## Test Case 4:
### Test Name: High Availability
#### Test Description: Validate the high availability and failover mechanisms of the router.
```bash
1. Verify the redundancy and failover of power supplies and cooling fans
2. Test the functionality of redundant Control Boards (CBs) and Routing Engines (REs)
3. Validate the operation of graceful Routing Engine switchover (GRES)
4. Check the failover time and stability of network connections during hardware and software failures
```

## Test Case 5:
### Test Name: Performance and Scalability
#### Test Description: Test the performance and scalability of the router under various load conditions.
```bash
1. Measure the throughput and latency of packet forwarding under different traffic patterns
2. Validate the QoS (Quality of Service) and traffic shaping capabilities
3. Test the scalability of the router in terms of the number of supported interfaces and routing entries
4. Verify the ability to handle large-scale network deployments and heavy network traffic
```

These unit test cases cover various aspects of the Network MX480 Router, including interfaces configuration, routing protocols, security features, high availability, and performance/scalability.
