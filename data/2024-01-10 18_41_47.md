Sample code snippet:

...
set interfaces ge-0/0/0 unit 0 family inet address 192.168.1.1/24
set interfaces ge-0/0/1 unit 0 family inet address 192.168.2.1/24
...
```

## Test Case 1: Interface Configuration
### Setup
1. Connect to MX480 via console or SSH.
2. Enter configuration mode.

### Execution
```bash
set interfaces ge-0/0/0 unit 0 description "Test Interface"
set interfaces ge-0/0/0 unit 0 family inet address 192.168.1.1/24
commit
```

### Verification
```bash
show interfaces ge-0/0/0
```
Output:
```
Physical interface: ge-0/0/0, Enabled, Physical link is Up
  Description: Test Interface
  ...
  ...
```

### Teardown
1. Delete the configured interface.
2. Commit the changes.

## Test Case 2: Routing Configuration
### Setup
1. Connect to MX480 via console or SSH.
2. Enter configuration mode.

### Execution
```bash
set routing-options static route 10.0.0.0/24 next-hop 192.168.1.2
commit
```

### Verification
```bash
show route 10.0.0.0/24
```
Output:
```
inet.0: 10 destinations, 10 routes (10 active, 0 holddown, 0 hidden)
+ = Active Route, - = Last Active, * = Both

10.0.0.0/24       *[Static/5] 00:01:23
                    > to 192.168.1.2 via ge-0/0/0.0
```

### Teardown
1. Delete the configured route.
2. Commit the changes.

1. Interface connectivity
2. Routing table consistency
3. Service availability
4. Traffic throughput

## Test Execution
To run the regression test, execute the following Python script:

```python
python mx480_regression_test.py
```

## Test Results
Upon completion of the test, the script will provide detailed results for each scenario. Any failures or issues will be reported along with relevant diagnostic information.

## Conclusion
The MX480 regression test is essential for ensuring the reliability and performance of the MX480 router. By validating various scenarios, we can confidently deploy the router in production environments.

# MX480 Router Regression Test

## Overview
The regression test will be conducted to verify the configuration of the MX480 router. This test will ensure that the router operates according to the specified configurations and does not introduce any unexpected behavior that may affect its functionality.

## Test Environment
- **Device:** MX480 Router
- **Software Version:** Junos OS 18.3R1
- **Test Setup:** The router is connected to a test network with specific traffic patterns

## Test Procedure
1. **Preparation:** Backup the current configuration of the router and save it for reference.
2. **Test Configuration:** Apply the test configurations to the router, including routing protocols, interface settings, and security policies.
3. **Traffic Generation:** Generate synthetic traffic to simulate the expected traffic patterns on the network.
4. **Observation:** Monitor the router's performance and behavior during the traffic generation to identify any deviations from the expected behavior.
5. **Verification:** Compare the observed behavior with the expected behavior based on the configured settings.

## Test Scenarios
### Scenario 1: Routing Protocols
- **Description:** Test the functionality of OSPF and BGP routing protocols.
- **Expected Outcome:** The router should successfully establish neighbor relationships and exchange routing information with neighboring routers.

```bash
show ospf neighbor
show bgp summary
```

### Scenario 2: Interface Configurations
- **Description:** Verify the configuration of interfaces, including VLAN assignments and link settings.
- **Expected Outcome:** All interfaces should be properly configured and operational.

```bash
show interfaces
```

### Scenario 3: Security Policies
- **Description:** Validate the application of security policies, including firewall rules and traffic filtering.
- **Expected Outcome:** The router should correctly enforce the defined security policies without impacting legitimate traffic.

```bash
show security policies
```

## Test Results
The test results indicate that the MX480 router successfully passed all test scenarios, demonstrating that the configured settings are functioning as expected without any deviations or unexpected behavior observed.
