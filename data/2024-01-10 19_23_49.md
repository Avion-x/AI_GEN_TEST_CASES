# Unit Test Cases for Network MSeries Router MX480

## Test Case 1: Interface Configuration
### Description:
Check if the router allows configuration of interfaces using the appropriate commands.

### Test Steps:
1. Connect to the router using SSH or console.
2. Enter configuration mode and configure a new interface.
3. Verify if the interface configuration is successful.

### Expected Output:
```
[edit interfaces]
user@router# set ge-0/0/0 unit 0 family inet address 192.168.1.1/24
```

## Test Case 2: OSPF Configuration
### Description:
Verify if the router allows OSPF configuration and establishes neighbor relationships.

### Test Steps:
1. Configure the OSPF protocol and parameters on the router.
2. Verify if the neighbor relationships are established with adjacent routers.

### Expected Output:
```
[edit protocols ospf]
user@router# set area 0.0.0.0 interface ge-0/0/0.0
user@router# run show ospf neighbor
```

## Test Case 3: BGP Configuration
### Description:
Test the BGP configuration capability of the router.

### Test Steps:
1. Configure the BGP protocol and establish a peering relationship with a remote BGP neighbor.
2. Verify if the BGP session is established and routes are exchanged.

### Expected Output:
```
[edit protocols bgp]
user@router# set group external-peers neighbor 192.168.2.1
user@router# run show bgp summary
```

## Test Case 4: MPLS Configuration
### Description:
Check if the router supports MPLS configuration and label distribution.

### Test Steps:
1. Configure MPLS protocols and enable LDP on the interfaces.
2. Verify if the router is distributing MPLS labels to neighboring routers.

### Expected Output:
```
[edit protocols mpls]
user@router# set interfaces ge-0/0/0.0
user@router# run show ldp neighbor
```

## Test Case 5: High Availability
### Description:
Test the high availability features of the router, such as graceful restart and non-stop routing.

### Test Steps:
1. Configure high availability features on the router.
2. Simulate a failure scenario and verify if the router maintains routing without interruption.

### Expected Output:
```
[edit routing-options]
user@router# set non-stop-routing
```
