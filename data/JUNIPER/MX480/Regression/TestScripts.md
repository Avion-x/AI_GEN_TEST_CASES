Sure, here is an example of a Python script for a regression test for a linear regression model.

You can have this script in a file called `linear_regression_test.py`:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate some random data
np.random.seed(0)
X = np.random.rand(100, 1)
y = 2 + 3 * X + np.random.rand(100, 1)

# Split the data into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Train the linear regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Calculate mean squared error
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)

# Plot the data and the fitted line
plt.scatter(X_test, y_test, color='black')
plt.plot(X_test, y_pred, color='blue', linewidth=3)
plt.show()
```

And here is an example of how you can provide data in markdown format for the test:

# Linear Regression Test
## Description
This test is for evaluating the performance of a linear regression model using random data. The model is trained and tested, and the mean squared error is calculated to assess the accuracy of the predictions.

## Steps
1. Generate random data for training and testing
2. Split the data into training and test sets
3. Train a linear regression model on the training data
4. Make predictions using the test data
5. Calculate the mean squared error
6. Plot the test data and the fitted line

## Code Snippet
```
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# ... (code from the script goes here)
```

This format provides a clear structure for the test and the corresponding Python script.
