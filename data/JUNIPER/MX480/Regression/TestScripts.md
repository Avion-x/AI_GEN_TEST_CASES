Sure, here's an example of a Python script for a simple regression test. This script tests the functionality of a basic math operation, such as addition. I'll also include some example data with markdown formatting.

1. Create a new Python file called `test_addition.py`.

2. In the `test_addition.py` file, write the following Python code:
```python
def test_addition():
    assert 2 + 2 == 4

def main():
    test_addition()
    print("All tests passed!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
Now, here's some example data with markdown formatting:

# Regression Test for Addition Functionality

## Purpose
The purpose of this test is to ensure that the addition operation in our code is functioning correctly.

## Test Overview
The `test_addition` function is used to check if the addition operation yields the expected result.

## Test Data
```python
def test_addition():
    assert 2 + 2 == 4
```

## Expected Output
```
All tests passed!
```
