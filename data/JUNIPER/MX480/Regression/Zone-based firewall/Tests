###ENDLIST###

The test cases cover zone-based firewall rule validation and failover scenarios. The associated test scripts leverage paramiko, ncclient to carry out the test steps over SSH and NETCONF. Hopefully this helps with regression testing the firewall functionality. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements.
