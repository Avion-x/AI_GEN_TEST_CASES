commit
```

### Verification:
- Check the configured interface details.

```
show interfaces ge-0/0/0
```

- Verify the IP address configuration.

```
show configuration interfaces ge-0/0/0
```

The regression tests verify the configuration and functionality of the MX480 device to ensure that it is operating as expected after any changes or updates.

## MX480 Regression Test
### Data Collection

During the regression test of the MX480, we collected the following data:

- Input traffic load: 50 Gbps
- Number of active interfaces: 10
- CPU utilization: 60%
- Memory utilization: 70%
- Packet loss: 0.1%

### Test Results

Upon completion of the regression test, the following results were obtained:

- Throughput: 48 Gbps
- Latency: 10 ms
- Packet loss: 0.05%
- CPU utilization: 55%
- Memory utilization: 65%

### Analysis

From the test results, it is evident that the MX480 operated within acceptable parameters for the given input traffic load. The observed decrease in CPU and memory utilization indicates efficient resource management. The slight improvement in packet loss and latency also reflects the stability of the router's performance under the tested conditions.

```python
# Sample Python code for regression test analysis
throughput = 48
latency = 10
packet_loss = 0.05
cpu_utilization = 55
memory_utilization = 65

print(f"Throughput: {throughput} Gbps")
print(f"Latency: {latency} ms")
print(f"Packet loss: {packet_loss}%")
print(f"CPU utilization: {cpu_utilization}%")
print(f"Memory utilization: {memory_utilization}%")
```
