   - **Inputs:** Configuration changes in routing protocols, network topology changes
   - **Expected Output:** Routing and switching protocols should converge quickly and maintain network stability.

4. **Test Case:** Verify protocol convergence time after a network failure or change in network topology.
   - **Inputs:** Simulated network failure, dynamic routing updates
   - **Expected Output:** Routing protocols should quickly adapt to the changes in the network and converge within the expected time frame.

#### Hardware Redundancy
5. **Test Case:** Ensure failover functionality by simulating a hardware failure and verifying the switch to redundant components.
   - **Inputs:** Forced failure of a line card or power supply
   - **Expected Output:** The router should seamlessly switch to redundant hardware components without impacting network connectivity.

#### Configuration Management
6. **Test Case:** Validate configuration changes by applying and verifying different configurations.
   - **Inputs:** Changes to routing configurations, firewall rules, interface configurations
   - **Expected Output:** The router should accept and apply configuration changes without any errors, and the network should continue to operate as expected.

7. **Test Case:** Verify rollback functionality by reverting to previous configurations and ensuring proper network behavior.
   - **Inputs:** Reverting to previous configurations after making changes
   - **Expected Output:** The router should successfully revert to previous configurations without any impact on network operations.

#### Scale and Performance
8. **Test Case:** Test the router's performance under high loads and traffic congestion scenarios.
   - **Inputs:** High traffic loads, congestion scenarios
   - **Expected Output:** The router should handle high traffic loads without dropping packets or experiencing performance degradation.
