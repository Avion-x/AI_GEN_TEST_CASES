# Regression Test Cases for the Network M Series Router MX480

## Test Case 1: Power On Self Test (POST)

### Description
Verify that the router passes the Power On Self Test without any errors or failures.

### Steps
1. Power on the router.
2. Monitor the diagnostic tests performed during startup.
3. Ensure that all tests pass successfully.

### Expected Result
The router should boot up without any errors and indicate a successful POST.

## Test Case 2: Interface Connectivity

### Description
Verify that all interfaces on the router are functioning properly and can successfully establish connections.

### Steps
1. Connect a device to each interface on the router.
2. Send and receive test data through each interface.
3. Check for any communication errors or dropped packets.

### Expected Result
All interfaces should demonstrate stable connectivity and successful data transmission without any errors.

## Test Case 3: Routing Table

### Description
Verify that the router's routing table is correctly populated with the appropriate network routes.

### Steps
1. Access the router's command-line interface.
2. View the routing table using the appropriate command.
3. Check for the presence of expected network routes.

### Expected Result
The routing table should contain all expected network routes and should be accurately updated based on network changes.

```bash
show route
```

## Test Case 4: Traffic Load Balancing

### Description
Verify that the router properly distributes network traffic across multiple paths for load balancing purposes.

### Steps
1. Generate network traffic that traverses the router.
2. Monitor the traffic distribution across different paths and interfaces.
3. Verify that the traffic is evenly distributed for load balancing.

### Expected Result
The router should effectively distribute network traffic across available paths for load balancing, without any noticeable bottlenecks.

## Test Case 5: Failover and Redundancy

### Description
Verify that the router can seamlessly handle failover scenarios and maintain network connectivity during hardware or link failures.

### Steps
1. Simulate a link or interface failure on the router.
2. Monitor the router's response and transition to redundant paths.
3. Verify that network connectivity is maintained without disruption.

### Expected Result
The router should seamlessly transition to redundant paths and maintain network connectivity without any noticeable interruptions.
