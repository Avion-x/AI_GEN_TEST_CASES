 Unfortunately I do not have access to the specific python scripts or test cases for the Juniper Networks MX480 router bootup process. As an AI assistant without access to internal Juniper networks systems or documentation, I cannot provide proprietary test scripts or outputs. 

However, I can describe at a high level what unit testing the router bootup process might involve:

### Bootup Process Unit Tests

**Test case 1 - valid boot configuration**

- Set up test fixture with valid boot configuration (e.g. valid boot statements pointing to appropriate boot medium)
- Power on router 
- Assert router progresses through normal boot phases (e.g. POST, loading kernel, etc.)
- Assert router reaches operational state 

**Test case 2 - invalid boot configuration**

- Set up test fixture with invalid boot configuration (e.g. pointing to non-existent boot medium)
- Power on router
- Assert appropriate error condition occurs (e.g. reports failure to load OS)
- Assert router does not reach operational state

**Test case 3 - corrupted boot medium**

- Set up test fixture with valid boot configuration 
- Modify contents of boot medium to introduce errors
- Power on router
- Assert appropriate error condition occurs (e.g. failed integrity checks) 
- Assert router does not reach operational state

**Test case 4 - hardware component failures**

- Set up test fixture with valid boot configuration
- Introduce hardware faults (e.g. disconnect or damage key components)
- Power on router 
- Assert appropriate error condition occurs (e.g. POST failures)
- Assert router does not reach operational state

These test cases would validate proper handling of different boot-up error conditions and hardware failures. Other tests could focus on performance, security, logs/tracing etc. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions! Here is a Python script for a unit test to validate the bootup process of an MX480 router, along with sample markdown formatted output:

```python
import unittest
from netmiko import ConnectHandler

class TestMX480Bootup(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_bootup(self):
        device = {
            "device_type": "juniper",
            "host": "mx480.example.com",
            "username": "pyuser",
            "password": "pypass123",
        }
        
        net_connect = ConnectHandler(**device)
        output = net_connect.send_command("show version")
        
        # Validate expected version string
        self.assertIn("Junos OS Release", output)
        
        # Validate successful boot 
        self.assertIn("Current state: Active", output)
        
if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

Markdown output:

# Unit Test Report

## Test: TestMX480Bootup

- **Status**: PASS 
- **Description**: Validates MX480 router bootup to active state and verifies Junos OS version string
- **Expected Result**: 
    - Junos OS Release string present in output
    - Current state showing as Active
- **Actual Result**: Both expected results were found in the output of `show version` command 

The script connects to the MX480 router, runs `show version`, and checks that the expected version string and active status are present in the command output to validate successful bootup.
