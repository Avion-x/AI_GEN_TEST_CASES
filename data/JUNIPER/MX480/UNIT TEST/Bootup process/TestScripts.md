 Unfortunately I do not have access to the specific test scripts or test cases for the Juniper Networks MX480 router. As an AI assistant without access to internal company resources, I cannot provide proprietary test scripts or test cases. 

However, I can provide a general template for unit testing the bootup process in Python and some high level guidance on how the tests might work:

**test_bootup.py**

```python
import unittest
from router import Router

class TestBootup(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_bios_post(self):
        # Test POST process completes successfully
        router = Router()
        self.assertTrue(router.bios_post())
        
    def test_loader_initialized(self):
        # Test loader software initializes properly
        router = Router() 
        self.assertTrue(router.verify_loader())
        
    def test_kernel_boots(self):
        # Test main kernel boots up
        router = Router()
        self.assertTrue(router.kernel_up())

    def test_services_start(self):
        # Test key services initialize on boot
        router = Router()
        services = ["routing", "ssh"]
        for service in services:
            self.assertTrue(router.service_status(service))

if __name__ == '__main__':  
    unittest.main()
```

This shows some example test cases that could be used to verify and validate the router boot up processes and sequences by abstracting the router interactions into a Router class. Some key things the tests would likely cover:

- BIOS/POST boot sequence
- Loader firmware properly starts 
- Main kernel boots properly
- Key routing and management services initialize

The tests would simulate rebooting the router and validate expected state and services at each step in the sequence. Other tests could also check error handling cases like a failed boot.

Let me know if you have any other questions! Here is a sample Python unit test script for testing the bootup process on the Juniper MX480 Router:

```python
import unittest
from netmiko import ConnectHandler

class TestMX480Bootup(unittest.TestCase):

    def setUp(self):
        self.mx480 = {
            'device_type': 'juniper_junos',
            'host': 'mx480_ip',  
            'username': 'pyuser',
            'password': 'pypass',
        }
    
    def test_bootup_time(self):
        net_connect = ConnectHandler(**self.mx480)
        # Send reboot command and start timer
        net_connect.send_command("request system reboot")
        start = datetime.now()
        # Wait for device to come back up and login
        net_connect.find_prompt()
        end = datetime.now()
        # Check elapsed time is < 5 minutes
        bootup_time = (end - start).total_seconds() 
        self.assertLess(bootup_time, 300)

    def test_check_interfaces(self):
        net_connect = ConnectHandler(**self.mx480)
        # Check all expected interfaces are present
        interfaces = net_connect.send_command("show interfaces terse") 
        self.assertIn("ge-0/0/0", interfaces)
        self.assertIn("ge-0/0/1", interfaces)  

    def test_routing_protocols(self):
        net_connect = ConnectHandler(**self.mx480)
        # Check expected routing protocols are running
        self.assertIn("ospf", net_connect.send_command("show version"))
        self.assertIn("bgp", net_connect.send_command("show version"))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

This script:

1. Connects to the MX480 device 
2. Tests the bootup time is < 5 minutes
3. Checks all expected interfaces are present 
4. Checks that OSPF and BGP are enabled after reboot

To run:

```
python test_mx480_bootup.py
```

This would run the unit tests and report pass/fail for each one. Additional tests could be added to validate other components come up properly after reboot.
