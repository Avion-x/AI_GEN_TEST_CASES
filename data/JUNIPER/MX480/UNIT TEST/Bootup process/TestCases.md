 Here are some sample unit tests for the bootup process of the Juniper Networks MX Series MX480 router:

## Bootup Process Unit Tests

### Test bootup with valid junos image

- Load a valid junos image onto the Routing Engine's boot media
- Power on the router 
- Verify the bootup process completes successfully and the router reaches operational state

**Expected result:** Router boots up successfully to operational state

### Test bootup with invalid junos image 

- Load an invalid or corrupted junos image onto the Routing Engine's boot media
- Power on the router
- Verify bootup process fails with appropriate error message

**Expected result:** Router fails to boot up and displays error indicating invalid junos image

### Test bootup with missing junos image

- Remove any junos image from the Routing Engine's boot media 
- Power on the router
- Verify bootup process fails with appropriate error message

**Expected result:** Router fails to boot up and displays error indicating missing junos image

### Test Routing Engine redundancy during bootup

- Load valid junos images on both Routing Engine's boot media
- Power on the router
- Verify both Routing Engines boot up successfully and router achieves redundancy  
- Power off the master Routing Engine
- Verify redundant Routing Engine takes over as new master

**Expected result:** Router achieves full redundancy with both Routing Engines operational after bootup. Failover to redundant Routing Engine successful when master is powered off.

### Test bootup timer expiration

- Set bootup timer to 60 seconds
- Power on the router
- Verify router reaches operational state within 60 seconds

**Expected result:** Router successfully boots up within configured 60 second time limit Here are sample unit test cases for the bootup process on an MX480 router in markdown format:

## Test Cases for MX480 Bootup Process

### TC1 - Cold Boot

**Setup:**
- Power off the MX480 completely
- Connect console cable to console port for monitoring

**Execution:**
- Power on the MX480 and allow it to complete full bootup process

**Verification:**
- Verify console prints normal boot messages including:
  - BIOS initialization
  - Loading Junos OS
  - Completing POST 
  - Checking filesystems
  - Loading default configuration
  - Daemons and processes starting
  - `JUNOS CHASSISD READY` message

**Teardown:**
- None

### TC2 - Fast Reboot

**Setup:** 
- MX480 powered on with Junos OS running
- Connect console cable to console port for monitoring

**Execution:**
- From CLI execute `request system reboot` 

**Verification:**
- Verify console prints fast reboot messages including:
  - Bypassing full POST
  - Checking filesystems
  - Reloading configuration
  - Daemons and processes restarting
  - `JUNOS CHASSISD READY` message  

**Teardown:**
- None

### TC3 - Reboot to Rescue Configuration

**Setup:**
- MX480 powered on with Junos OS running 
- Connect console cable to console port for monitoring

**Execution:**
- From CLI execute `request system reboot rescue`

**Verification:** 
- Verify console prints rescue reboot messages including:
  - Loading rescue configuration
  - Limited daemons and processes starting
  - `JUNOS RESCUE CONFIGURATION READY` message

**Teardown:** 
- Execute `request system reboot` to reboot back to normal Junos OS Here is a detailed Python unit test for the bootup process of the Juniper MX480 router in Markdown format:

```python
import unittest
from router import MX480

class TestMX480Bootup(unittest.TestCase):

    def setUp(self):
        self.router = MX480()

    def test_bootup_process(self):
        """Test MX480 bootup process"""
        
        # Power on and load boot loader
        self.router.power_on()
        self.assertEqual(self.router.get_state(), "bootloader")
        
        # Load Junos OS kernel 
        self.router.load_kernel()
        self.assertEqual(self.router.get_state(), "kernel")
        
        # Load init process and basic services
        self.router.load_init()
        self.assertIn("rpcd", self.router.get_services())
        
        # Load daemons and kernel modules
        self.router.load_daemons()
        self.assertIn("rpd", self.router.get_daemons())
        
        # Complete bootup and ready state
        self.router.complete_bootup() 
        self.assertEqual(self.router.get_state(), "ready")
        
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

This test case verifies the major steps in the MX480 bootup process:

- Power on and load boot loader 
- Load Junos OS kernel
- Load init process and basic services  
- Load daemons and kernel modules
- Complete bootup to reach ready state

Each step is validated by checking the router state and services/daemons loaded at each stage. The test case provides a basic framework that can be built upon to add more detailed validation for each bootup step. Here is a sample unit test in markdown format for testing the bootup process on an MX480 router:

## Bootup Process Test

### Test Objective

Verify that the MX480 router boots up correctly with the expected configuration.

### Test Configuration

- Router model: Juniper MX480 
- Junos version: 19.2R1.9
- Configured interfaces: 
    - ge-0/0/0
    - ge-0/0/1 
    - xe-0/0/0
    - xe-0/0/1
- OSPF and BGP routing protocols configured
- Firewall filters configured

### Test Steps

1. Power on the MX480 router and monitor console output
2. Verify Junos version on bootup matches expected version
3. Check interfaces ge-0/0/0 and ge-0/0/1 status shows as up/up 
4. Check interfaces xe-0/0/0 and xe-0/0/1 status shows as up/up
5. Verify OSPF and BGP sessions are established 
6. Validate firewall filters are configured 
7. Ping external IPs to check connectivity 
8. Examine routing table to verify routes installed correctly

### Expected Results

- Router should boot up normally and display expected Junos version
- All configured interfaces should come up properly 
- OSPF and BGP sessions should establish with peers
- Firewall filters should be present 
- Pings to external IPs should be successful
- Routing table should have correct routes installed

### Test Result

PASS / FAIL / INCONCLUSIVE
