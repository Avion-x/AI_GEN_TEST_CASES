 Here are some example unit tests for bootup process cases for the Juniper Networks MX480 router:

# Unit Tests for MX480 Router Bootup

## Test MX480 boots up successfully

- Power on the MX480 router
- Verify the POWER LED turns green
- Verify the STATUS LED turns green 
- Verify the router finishes booting and 'READY' message is displayed on console

## Test bootup with corrupted boot loader

- Modify boot loader on flash to corrupt it
- Power on the MX480 router
- Verify boot process fails with error message on console
- Verify router does not boot and enter normal operation

## Test bootup with corrupted JUNOS

- Modify JUNOS system partition to corrupt it
- Power on the MX480 router 
- Verify boot process fails with error message on console
- Verify router enters safe mode and prompts for manual recovery

## Test bootup with corrupted configuration

- Modify main configuration on flash to corrupt it
- Power on the MX480 router
- Verify router boots up successfully 
- Verify error is logged about corrupted configuration
- Verify router boots with factory default configuration

## Test bootup with invalid configuration

- Modify main configuration with incorrect syntax
- Power on the MX480 router
- Verify router boots up successfully
- Verify error is logged about invalid configuration 
- Verify router boots with factory default configuration

## Test bootup with missing configuration

- Delete main configuration file from flash
- Power on the MX480 router
- Verify router boots up successfully
- Verify router boots with factory default configuration Here is an example unit test case for the bootup process on an MX480 router in markdown format:

## Test Case: Normal Bootup

### Setup
- Power off the MX480 router

### Execution
- Power on the MX480 router and allow it to fully boot up

### Verification
- Verify the STATUS LED turns green after booting up
- Verify you can log in to the CLI successfully 
- Verify all expected interfaces come up properly
- Verify all control plane protocols like OSPF, BGP etc. establish peering and converge as expected
- Verify all data plane forwarding works as expected

### Teardown
- Power off the MX480 router

## Test Case: Bootup with Corrupted Filesystem

### Setup 
- Power off the MX480 router
- Corrupt the filesystem by deleting some key files like /etc/init.d/rcS

### Execution
- Power on the MX480 router and allow it to boot up

### Verification
- Verify bootup fails and drops to recovery shell
- Verify appropriate error messages are logged 

### Teardown
- Power off the MX480 router
- Restore corrupted files so device is back to normal state

## Test Case: Excessive Reboots

### Setup
- Power on the MX480 router and allow it to fully boot up

### Execution
- Issue multiple reboots (e.g. 5 reboots) in quick succession 

### Verification
- Verify the router reboots successfully every time
- Verify no crash messages or tracebacks are seen
- Verify boot time is under expected threshold each reboot

### Teardown
- No action required Here is a sample Python unit test for the bootup process of the Juniper MX480 router in Markdown format:

```python
import unittest
from device_controller import MX480

class MX480BootupTest(unittest.TestCase):
    
    def setUp(self):
        self.router = MX480()
        
    def test_bootup(self):
        '''Test MX480 bootup process'''
        
        # Power on and check power LED
        self.router.power_on() 
        self.assertTrue(self.router.power_led_on())
        
        # Check supervisor modules bootup
        for sup in self.router.sup_modules:
            self.assertTrue(sup.bootup())
            
        # Check line cards bootup
        for lc in self.router.line_cards:
            self.assertTrue(lc.bootup())
            
        # Check Routing Engine bootup
        self.assertTrue(self.router.re.bootup())
        
        # Check FPCs bootup
        for fpc in self.router.fpcs:
            self.assertTrue(fpc.bootup())
            
        # Check software components bootup
        self.assertTrue(self.router.boot_loader.load_junos())
        self.assertTrue(self.router.kernel.bootup())
        self.assertTrue(self.router.daemons.bootup())
        
    def tearDown(self):
        self.router.power_down()
        
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

This test cases initializes a MX480 device, and then checks the bootup process step-by-step:

- Power on and validate power LED
- Check Supervisor modules boot 
- Check Line Cards boot
- Check Routing Engine boot
- Check FPCs boot
- Check Junos bootloader, kernel and daemons bootup

After the test, the device is powered down safely.

The `device_controller` module contains classes to simulate and control the test device. The test assertions validate the bootup result at each step. Here is a sample unit test for the bootup process on an MX480 router in markdown format:

## MX480 Router Bootup Process Test

### Test Setup

- Router model: MX480
- Junos version: 19.2R1.9
- Test location: Lab environment

### Test Steps

1. Power on the router and connect to the console port 
2. Verify the boot sequence:

    ```
    Booting kernel
    Starting kernel ...

    Initializing cgroup subsys cpuset
    Initializing cgroup subsys cpu
    Initializing cgroup subsys cpuacct
    Linux version 4.9.0 (builder@builder.netconf.juniper.net) 
    ...
    ```

3. Verify the Junos version:

    ```
