 Here are some example unit tests for bootup process cases for the Juniper Networks MX480 router:

```markdown

- Issue request to fail over to backup RE
- Verify failover occurs successfully 
- Verify router remains operational with backup RE as new master
- Issue request to fail back to original master RE
- Verify failback occurs successfully

## Test MX480 corrupted boot image handling

- Power on MX480 router
- Interrupt boot process and corrupt the boot image
- Verify router detects corrupted boot image
- Verify router boots from alternate boot image
- Verify router operates correctly with alternate image

## Test MX480 image rollback

- Power on MX480 router with primary and alternate boot images
- Allow router to fully boot up with primary image
- Trigger router to roll back and boot from alternate image
- Verify router boots successfully from alternate image
- Verify router operates correctly with rolled back image

## Test MX480 minimum boot configuration

- Power on MX480 router with factory default configuration
- Interrupt boot process and clear entire configuration
- Allow router to finish booting up
- Verify router boots up to operational mode with minimum default config
- Verify basic IP connectivity to router for management

``` Here is a sample unit test case for the bootup process on an MX480 router in Markdown format:

## Test Case: MX480 Bootup

### Objective
Verify the MX480 router boots up successfully.

### Setup
- Connect console cable to MX480
- Power on MX480

### Test Steps
1. Verify console displays Juniper copyright message 
2. Verify console displays booting kernel
3. Verify console displays starting daemons
4. Verify console displays login prompt

### Validation
- Juniper copyright message is displayed
- Kernel boot messages are displayed
- Daemon startup messages are displayed 
- Login prompt is displayed

### Teardown
- Power off MX480
- Disconnect console cable

This covers the basic steps of the boot process - verifying the copyright, kernel boot, daemon startup, and getting a login prompt. Additional test cases could be added to cover specific daemons, kernel modules, interfaces coming up, etc. The test would pass if the console output matches the expected results at each step. Here is a Python unit test for the bootup process of the Juniper MX480 router in Markdown format:

```python
import unittest
from junos import Device

class TestMX480Bootup(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_bootup(self):
        """Test MX480 bootup process"""
        
        # Connect to the device
        dev = Device(host='mx480', user='testuser', password='test123')  
        dev.open()
        
        # Check that all components have booted up successfully
        self.assertEqual(dev.facts['master'], 'RE0')
        self.assertEqual(len(dev.facts['RE']), 2)
        self.assertEqual(dev.facts['RE']['mastership-state'], 'master')
        self.assertEqual(dev.facts['RE']['status'], 'OK')
        
        self.assertEqual(len(dev.facts['FPC']), 4)
        for fpc in dev.facts['FPC'].values():
            self.assertEqual(fpc['state'], 'Online') 
        
        self.assertEqual(len(dev.facts['PIC']), 8)   
        for pic in dev.facts['PIC'].values():
            self.assertEqual(pic['state'], 'Online')
            
        # Check overall system status
        self.assertEqual(dev.facts['RE']['mastership-state'], 'master')
        self.assertEqual(dev.facts['switch_style'], 'BRIDGE_DOMAIN')
        self.assertEqual(dev.facts['virtual'], False)
        
        dev.close()
        
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

This test case connects to the MX480 device, gathers facts about the system components, and asserts that the expected mastership, redundancy, and component states indicate a successful bootup. It checks the RE, FPC, and PIC components specifically. Here is a sample unit test in markdown format for bootup process on MX480 router to verify configuration:

## Bootup Process Unit Test

### Test Setup

- Router: MX480
- Junos version: 19.2R1.9

### Test Steps

1. Power on the MX480 router and wait for it to fully boot 
2. Verify Junos version with `show version` 
   - Expected output: 
     ```
     Junos: 19.2R1.9
     ```
3. Verify current configuration with `show configuration`
   - Verify key settings like interfaces, routing protocols, firewall filters etc match expected config
4. Verify routing table with `show route`
   - Ensure main routes are present as per expected config
5. Verify interface status with `show interfaces` 
   - Ensure all expected interfaces are up/active 
6. Verify protocols status 
   - Verify OSPF, BGP neighbors with `show ospf neighbor`, `show bgp summary` 
   - Ensure expected neighbors are up
7. Perform configuration commit 
   - Verify commit succeeds without errors
8. Verify no alarms with `show chassis alarms`
9. Verify forwarding table with `show route forwarding-table`
   - Ensure forwarding table matches routing table   
10. Verify traffic forwarding with pings, traceroutes to destinations

### Test Result

- Bootup completed successfully 
- Routing protocols converged 
- Traffic forwarding working correctly

### Verdict

- PASS. Router bootup and configuration verified successfully.
