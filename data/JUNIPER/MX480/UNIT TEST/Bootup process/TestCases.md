 Here are some example unit tests for bootup process cases for the Juniper Networks MX480 router in markdown format:

```
# Bootup process tests for MX480 router

## Test startup with valid startup configuration
- Load valid startup configuration file
- Power on router
- Verify router boots up successfully 
- Verify correct firmware version is running
- Verify all expected interfaces come up properly

## Test startup with invalid startup configuration
- Load invalid startup configuration file with errors
- Power on router 
- Verify router detects errors and fails to boot
- Verify error messages are logged indicating configuration errors

## Test startup with corrupted startup configuration
- Load corrupted startup configuration file
- Power on router
- Verify router fails to boot 
- Verify router loads backup default configuration
- Verify router comes up with default configuration

## Test startup with missing startup configuration
- Remove startup configuration file
- Power on router
- Verify router detects missing configuration 
- Verify router loads backup default configuration 
- Verify router comes up with default factory configuration

## Test startup with power loss
- Load valid startup configuration
- Power on router
- Allow router to fully boot up
- Power off router mid-operation
- Power on router
- Verify router resumes boot with previous startup configuration
- Verify no configuration loss or errors occur
```

This covers some basic test cases related to bootup and startup configuration loading on the MX480 router. Additional cases could be added for other bootup aspects and failure scenarios. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements. Unfortunately I do not have enough context to provide a detailed Python unit test for the bootup process of an MX480 device. A few clarifying details would help me generate a more useful response:

- MX480 seems to refer to a Juniper Networks router/switch, but more context on what specifically you want to test in the bootup process would be helpful. 

- Unit tests typically test small modular pieces of code, while a bootup process may span multiple components. Do you want tests for a specific module/component involved in bootup, or higher level validation of the overall bootup sequence?

- Python unit tests usually follow a standard structure using the unittest module and test case classes. Do you want just the test logic and assertions, or a runnable test script stubbed out with imports, class definitions etc?

- For output, do you require a complete runnable Python test script in markdown code blocks? Or just descriptions of sample test cases with assertions in markdown?

With more details on the specific thing you want to test, the scope/coverage goals, and expected output format, I can attempt to provide a more tailored Python test case or test plan outline for an MX480 boot sequence. Please provide any additional context or details that would help formulate an appropriate Python testing approach.
