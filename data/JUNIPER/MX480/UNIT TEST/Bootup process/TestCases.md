 Here are some example unit tests for bootup process cases for the Juniper Networks MX480 router in markdown format:

## Bootup Process Unit Tests

### Test bootup with valid config

**Expected Result**: Device boots up successfully with correct config

### Test bootup with invalid config 

- Load invalid boot config file with errors
- Power on device
- Verify device detects errors during bootup
- Verify error messages are logged 
- Verify device boots to safe mode with factory default config

**Expected Result**: Device detects errors, logs messages, and boots to safe mode

### Test bootup with corrupted config

**Expected Result**: Device detects missing file, logs warnings, and boots to safe mode

### Test bootup with bad image

- Load device with invalid boot image
- Power on device
- Verify device detects invalid boot image
- Verify error messages are logged
- Verify device enters maintenance mode/recovery mode

**Expected Result**: Device detects bad image, logs errors, and enters recovery mode Here are some example unit test cases for the bootup process on an MX480 router in markdown format:

## Test Case 1 - Cold Boot

### Setup
- Power off the MX480 router

### Execution
- Power on the MX480 router and allow it to complete the cold boot process

### Verification
- Verify the MX480 completes POST and boots to operational mode
- Verify all expected interfaces come up operationally 
- Verify control plane protocols like OSPF, BGP etc. establish adjacency with neighbors
- Verify data plane forwarding works as expected

### Teardown
- None required

## Test Case 2 - Warm Boot

### Setup 
- MX480 router powered on and in operational state

### Execution
- Issue `request system reboot` command on MX480 to trigger warm reboot

### Verification
- Verify router reboots within expected time frame
- Verify router maintains existing interface configurations
- Verify control plane protocols like OSPF, BGP reconnect without flap
- Verify data plane forwarding state is maintained during reboot

### Teardown
- None required

## Test Case 3 - Router Supervisor Switchover

### Setup
- MX480 in operational state with redundant Routing Engines

### Execution
- Trigger switchover from master to backup Routing Engine

### Verification
- Verify switchover occurs within expected timeframe
- Verify minimal traffic loss during switchover
- Verify protocols and data plane state sync from old master to new master
- Verify new master Routing Engine takes over management plane

### Teardown  
- Trigger failback to restore original master Routing Engine Here is a detailed Python unit test for the bootup process of the MX480 router in Markdown format:

```python
import unittest
from junos_connection import JunosConnection

class TestMX480Bootup(unittest.TestCase):

    def setUp(self):
        self.dev = JunosConnection(host='192.168.1.1', user='pyuser', password='pypass')
        self.dev.open()
    
    def test_bootup(self):
        print("## Bootup Process for MX480")
        
        print("### Power on Device")
        # Power on and wait for device to boot
        
        print("### Check FPCs") 
        # Check FPCs are powered on and operational
        
        fpc_status = self.dev.rpc.get_chassis_fpc()
        self.assertEqual(fpc_status['fpc-information']['fpc'][0]['state'], 'Online')
        
        print("### Check Routing Engines")
        # Verify both Routing Engines are running and in master/backup state
        
        re_status = self.dev.rpc.get_route_engine_information()
        self.assertEqual(re_status['route-engine-information'][0]['mastership-state'], 'master')
        self.assertEqual(re_status['route-engine-information'][1]['mastership-state'], 'backup')
        
        print("### Check Interfaces")
        # Verify interfaces are operational
        
        interfaces = self.dev.rpc.get_interface_information()
        ge_0_0_0 = interfaces['physical-interface'][0]
        self.assertEqual(ge_0_0_0['oper-status'], 'up')
        
        print("### Check Protocols")
        # Check required routing protocols are up
        
        bgp_summary = self.dev.rpc.get_bgp_summary_information()
        self.assertGreater(bgp_summary['bgp-peer-count'], 0)
        
        ospf_neighbor = self.dev.rpc.get_ospf_neighbor_information()
        self.assertGreater(ospf_neighbor['ospf-neighbor-count'], 0)
        
    def tearDown(self):
        self.dev.close()
        
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

This test cases initializes a connection to the device, and then runs various `rpc` calls to validate:

- FPCs are online
- Routing engines are in master/backup state  
- An interface is operationally up
- BGP and OSPF protocols are up

It prints some markdown headers and text to provide context on each step. The `setUp` and `tearDown` methods establish and close the connection. The assertions validate the desired state of the device during bootup. Here is a sample unit test in markdown format for testing the bootup process on an MX480 router:

## Test Bootup Process on MX480 Router

### Test Setup

- MX480 router with Junos OS Release 15.1R7.9
- Connect console port to test workstation
- Power off router 

### Test Steps

1. Power on the MX480 router and monitor console
2. Verify Junos OS boots up successfully 
   - Look for `FreeBSD/MIPS (mx480)` in boot messages
   - Look for `JUNOS Software Release` message
3. Verify FPCs come online
   - Look for FPC initialization messages 
   - Verify all FPCs are `Online` when operational
4. Verify Routing Engines come online 
   - Look for `re0` and `re1` initialization messages
   - Verify both REs are `Online` when operational
5. Verify default configuration loaded
   - Run `show configuration`
   - Verify factory default configuration is present
6. Verify no error messages during boot 
7. Verify interfaces initialized successfully
   - Look for ge-0/0/0 link up message
   - Run `show interfaces terse`
   - Verify all expected interfaces are up

### Test Result

- PASS if router boots up successfully with no errors
- FAIL if any issues found during bootup
