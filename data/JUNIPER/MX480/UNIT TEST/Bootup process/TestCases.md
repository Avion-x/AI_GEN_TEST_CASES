```python
import unittest
from router import MX480

class TestMX480Bootup(unittest.TestCase):
    
    def setUp(self):
        self.router = MX480()
        
    def test_power_on_self_test(self):
        # Verify POST completes successfully
        self.assertTrue(self.router.power_on_self_test())
        
    def test_load_boot_config(self):
        # Verify boot config is loaded from flash
        self.assertEqual(self.router.boot_config, self.router.flash_config)
        
    def test_load_junos(self):
        # Verify Junos OS is loaded into memory
        self.assertTrue(self.router.junos_loaded)
        
    def test_routing_engine_bootup(self):
        # Verify routing engines have booted successfully
        self.assertTrue(self.router.re0_active)
        self.assertTrue(self.router.re1_standby)
        
    def test_line_cards_ready(self):
        # Verify all expected line cards are powered up
        num_lc = len(self.router.line_cards)
        self.assertEqual(num_lc, 16)
        for lc in self.router.line_cards:
            self.assertTrue(lc.powered_up)
            
    def test_interfaces_ready(self):
        # Verify all interfaces are up
        for iface in self.router.interfaces:
            self.assertTrue(iface.link_up)
            
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

This test case verifies the key steps in the MX480 bootup process:

- Power on self test (POST) passes
- Boot config is loaded correctly 
- Junos OS is loaded into memory
- Routing engines boot up in active/standby mode
- Line cards are powered up
- Interfaces come up

Each test method verifies a different part of the bootup sequence. The `setUp` method creates a router instance to test against. Here is a sample unit test for verifying the bootup process on an MX480 router:

## Test Bootup Process on MX480 Router

### Test Setup

- MX480 router with Junos OS Release 18.4R1
- Console connection to MX480

### Test Steps

1. Power on the MX480 router and connect to the console port. Verify the boot sequence:

    ```
    Junos version: 18.4R1
    BIOS memory testing: passed
   Verifying digitally signed firmware image
    Starting runtime verification of junos
    %JUNIT-5-FPGACRCKSUMFAILED: FPC 0 PIC 0
    ...
    ```

2. Once the router has fully booted, verify the configured interfaces are up:

    ```
    admin@MX480> show interfaces terse 
    ge-0/0/0 up up
    ge-0/0/1 up up 
    ge-0/0/2 up up
    ...
    ```

3. Check that routing protocols have converged:

    ```
    admin@MX480> show bgp summary 
    Groups: 2 Peers: 4 Down peers: 0
    ...

    admin@MX480> show ospf neighbor 

    Neighbor ID Pri State Dead Time Address Interface
    192.0.2.2 1 Full/ - 00:00:35 192.0.2.2 ge-0/0/1.0   
    192.0.2.3 1 Full/ - 00:00:34 192.0.2.3 ge-0/0/2.0
    ```

4. Verify key services are operational:

    ```
    admin@MX480> show services ssl 
    Service type: HTTP status: enabled
    Service type: FTP status: enabled 
    ...

    admin@MX480> show services application-identification 
    Application identification service status: Enabled
    ```

5. Check system storage usage:

    ```
    admin@MX480> show system storage 
    Filesystem              Size       Used      Avail  Capacity  Mounted on
    /dev/sda               59G        3.1G       54G        6%    /
    /dev/sdb              101G       12G        85G       13%    /var
    ```

### Test Result

- Bootup process completed successfully 
- All expected interfaces came up
- Routing protocols converged 
- Key services enabled and operational
- Filesystems mounted with adequate free space

The MX480 router booted up properly as verified by configuration and service checks.
