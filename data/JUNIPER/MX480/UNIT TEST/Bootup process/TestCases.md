 Here are some example unit tests for bootup process cases for the Juniper Networks MX480 router:

## Bootup Process Unit Tests

### Test bootup with valid configuration

- Load a valid configuration file
- Power on the router
- Verify router finishes booting without errors
- Verify all expected interfaces come up correctly 

### Test bootup with invalid configuration

- Load an invalid configuration file with syntax errors
- Power on the router 
- Verify router detects errors on bootup
- Verify router falls back to default configuration

### Test bootup with corrupted configuration

- Load a corrupted configuration file
- Power on the router
- Verify router detects corrupt configuration 
- Verify router falls back to default configuration

### Test bootup with missing configuration

- Remove startup configuration file
- Power on the router
- Verify router boots up with factory default configuration

### Test bootup with simulated hardware failure

- Simulate failure of PFE or other hardware component
- Power on the router
- Verify router detects hardware failure
- Verify router boots up in degraded mode without failed component

### Test reboot process

- Load valid configuration 
- Reboot the router
- Verify reboot process completes successfully
- Verify router preserves valid configuration after reboot

### Test bootup timed performance

- Start timer
- Power on router
- Stop timer when router finishes booting
- Verify bootup time is within expected threshold (e.g. <120 seconds) Here is an example unit test plan for the bootup process of an MX480 router in Markdown format:

## Test Cases for MX480 Router Bootup

### TC1 - Cold Boot

**Setup:** 

- Power off the MX480
- Connect console cable to MX480
- Open terminal emulator and connect to console 

**Execution:**

1. Power on the MX480
2. Observe console output during bootup 

**Verification:**

- POST messages are displayed 
- Junos firmware boots up successfully
- Router finishes booting and displays login prompt

**Teardown:**

- Power off MX480
- Disconnect console cable

### TC2 - Warm Boot

**Setup:**

- Console connected to powered on MX480 

**Execution:**

1. Issue `request system reboot` command 
2. Observe console output during reboot

**Verification:** 

- Console displays normal reboot messages
- Router finishes rebooting and displays login prompt  

**Teardown:**

- None

### TC3 - Boot into Rescue Configuration

**Setup:**

- Console connected to powered on MX480

**Execution:**

1. Issue `request system reboot rescue` command
2. Observe console output 

**Verification:** 

- Console displays "rebooting to rescue configuration" 
- Rescue configuration bootup messages displayed
- Rescue prompt displayed 

**Teardown:** 

- Issue `request system reboot` to reboot back to normal mode Here is a detailed Python unit test for the bootup process of the Juniper MX480 router in Markdown format:

```python
import unittest
from mock import patch, call

class TestMX480Bootup(unittest.TestCase):

    @patch('mx480.PowerOn')
    @patch('mx480.LoadBootImage') 
    @patch('mx480.StartRoutingEngine')
    def test_bootup(self, mock_start_re, mock_load_boot, mock_power_on):
        
        # Test power on
        mock_power_on.return_value = True
        mx480 = MX480Router()
        mx480.power_on()
        mock_power_on.assert_called_once_with()
        
        # Test load boot image
        mock_load_boot.return_value = True
        mx480.load_boot_image()
        mock_load_boot.assert_called_once_with()
        
        # Test start routing engine
        mock_start_re.return_value = True 
        mx480.start_routing_engine()
        mock_start_re.assert_called_once_with()
        
        # Test full bootup
        mx480.bootup()
        calls = [call.power_on(), call.load_boot_image(), call.start_routing_engine()]
        mx480.mock_power_on.assert_has_calls(calls)
        
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

This test mocks the `PowerOn`, `LoadBootImage` and `StartRoutingEngine` methods of the MX480 router class. It tests each step in the bootup process separately, and then the full bootup sequence. It uses Python's unittest framework to make assertions about the expected method calls.

The test verifies that `power_on()` is called first, then `load_boot_image()`, then `start_routing_engine()`. Finally it checks that the full `bootup()` method makes these calls in the correct order. This validates the bootup sequence of the router. Here is a sample unit test in markdown format for testing the bootup process on an MX480 router:

# Unit Test - MX480 Router Bootup

## Test Setup

- Router model: MX480 
- Junos version: 19.2R1.9
- Test conducted on lab router in offline environment

## Test Steps

1. Power off the router and connect console cable to CON port  
2. Power on the router and interrupt boot process by pressing space bar at the prompt
3. Verify the following during bootup:
    - BIOS version matches expected version
    - Partition checking passes 
    - Kernel load successful 
    - Daemons start properly without errors
    - Commit check passes
    - FPCs come online 
    - Interface states are as expected
4. Allow router to complete boot process
5. Verify following after router is fully booted:
    - Ansible reports router is reachable
    - Verify interface status shows all ports up
    - Verify protocols such as BGP sessions are established
    - Verify FHRP protocol status as expected
    - Verify system logs show no errors
6. Configuration commit and check passes successfully 

## Test Results

- Router booted up properly without any issues
- All interfaces came online correctly
- All protocols established properly 
- No errors logged in system logs
- Configuration commit successful 

## Verdict

- **PASS**. Router bootup process completed successfully based on test steps.
