 Here are some potential unit test cases for the bootup process of the Juniper Networks MX480 router:

## Test Cases for MX480 Router Bootup

### TC1 - Power on self test

**Steps:**

1. Power on the MX480 router
2. Verify POST completes successfully 

**Expected Result:**

- Power on LED turns on
- Fans spin up 
- POST messages are printed to console
- No error messages during POST

### TC2 - Load boot loader 

**Steps:**  

1. Power on the MX480 router
2. Interrupt boot process to enter boot loader mode

**Expected Result:**

- Router enters boot loader mode 
- Boot loader version is displayed
- Boot loader prompt is available 

### TC3 - Load Junos OS

**Steps:**

1. With router in boot loader mode, issue `boot` command 
2. Observe boot process

**Expected Result:** 

- Junos OS boots successfully
- Junos version is displayed 
- Router transitions from boot loader to Junos OS
- All expected daemons start properly
- No errors displayed

### TC4 - Perform boot in rescue mode

**Steps:**

1. Power on router and interrupt boot process
2. Issue `boot -s` command to load rescue configuration

**Expected Result:** 

- Router boots into rescue mode
- Rescue configuration is loaded 
- Limited Junos OS functionality available in rescue mode
- Can access CLI in rescue mode

Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the unit test cases! Here are some example unit test cases for the bootup process on an MX480 router in markdown format:

## Test Case 1 - Bootup with valid config

### Setup
- Power off the router
- Clear the boot variables 
- Copy a valid startup configuration file to the boot disk

### Execution
- Power on the router

### Verification 
- Verify the router boots up successfully 
- Verify the startup configuration is loaded correctly by checking key settings like interfaces, routing protocols, etc.

### Teardown
- Power off the router
- Clear the startup configuration

## Test Case 2 - Bootup with invalid config 

### Setup
- Power off the router
- Copy an invalid startup configuration file to the boot disk 

### Execution
- Power on the router

### Verification
- Verify the router detects invalid configuration and boots to default config
- Verify key default settings like management interface IP, default route, etc. 

### Teardown 
- Power off the router
- Clear the invalid startup configuration

## Test Case 3 - Bootup with corrupted config

### Setup
- Power off the router 
- Copy a startup config file and corrupt it by deleting portions of the file

### Execution
- Power on the router

### Verification
- Verify the router detects corrupt configuration and boots to default config
- Verify key default settings like management interface IP, default route, etc.

### Teardown
- Power off the router
- Delete the corrupted startup configuration

## Test Case 4 - Bootup with missing config

### Setup 
- Power off the router
- Delete the startup configuration file from boot disk

### Execution
- Power on the router 

### Verification
- Verify the router boots up with factory default configuration
- Verify key default settings like management interface IP, default route, etc.

### Teardown
- Power off the router Here is a sample Python unit test for the bootup process of the MX480 router in markdown format:

```python
import unittest
from router import MX480

class MX480BootupTest(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_bootup(self):
        """Test MX480 router bootup process"""
        
        # Create MX480 router object
        router = MX480()
        
        # Verify components initialized
        self.assertIsNotNone(router.cpu) 
        self.assertIsNotNone(router.memory)
        self.assertIsNotNone(router.power_supply)
        
        # Verify boot sequence
        self.assertEqual(router.boot_sequence[0], "LOAD BOOTLOADER")
        self.assertEqual(router.boot_sequence[1], "LOAD KERNEL")
        self.assertEqual(router.boot_sequence[2], "LOAD FIRMWARE")
        
        # Validate bootup
        self.assertTrue(router.bootup())
        
        # Check system status after bootup
        self.assertEqual(router.get_status(), "READY")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

This test creates a MX480 router object, verifies the main components are initialized, checks the boot sequence steps, validates successful bootup and checks final system status. The assertions validate the expected bootup behavior. This covers the overall bootup workflow. Additional tests can be added for individual components initialization, kernel loading, etc. Here is a sample unit test in Markdown format for testing the bootup process on an MX480 router:

## Bootup Process Test

### Test Objective

Verify that the MX480 router boots up correctly with the expected configuration.

### Test Setup

- MX480 router with Junos OS Release 15.1R7.9
- Console connection to MX480
- Traffic generator connected to MX480 interfaces

### Test Steps

1. Power on the MX480 router
2. Verify console displays expected boot messages including:
    - BIOS version
    - Loading kernel
    - Checking filesystems 
    - Starting daemons
3. Verify Junos OS version matches expected 15.1R7.9
4. Verify default configuration loaded 
5. Verify interfaces are up with expected IP addresses
6. Send test traffic through MX480 interfaces
7. Verify traffic forwarding works as expected

### Test Results

- Bootup messages match expected
- Junos OS version verified as 15.1R7.9
- Default configuration loaded
- Interfaces up with correct IP addressing 
- Traffic forwarded correctly

### Verdict

PASS. The MX480 router booted up correctly with the expected default configuration. Traffic forwarding works as expected.
