 Here are some example unit tests for bootup process cases for the Juniper Networks MX480 router in markdown format:

```
# Test bootup with valid startup configuration
1. Copy valid startup configuration to router
2. Power on router
3. Verify router boots up successfully 
    - Check console logs for successful initialization of components
    - Verify protocols and interfaces come up correctly 
4. Verify router forwards traffic as expected

# Test bootup with invalid startup configuration
1. Copy invalid startup configuration to router (e.g. invalid interfaces)  
2. Power on router
3. Verify router detects errors during bootup 
    - Check console logs for errors
    - Verify router drops to safe mode 
4. Verify router does not forward traffic
5. Power cycle router and load valid startup config
6. Verify router boots up successfully

# Test bootup with corrupted startup configuration
1. Copy valid startup configuration to router
2. Corrupt the startup configuration file
3. Power on router 
4. Verify router detects errors during bootup
    - Check console logs for errors 
    - Verify router drops to safe mode
5. Verify router does not forward traffic 
6. Power cycle router and load valid startup config
7. Verify router boots up successfully 

# Test bootup with missing startup configuration
1. Power on router without a startup configuration
2. Verify router boots up to safe mode by default
3. Verify router creates a default blank configuration
4. Verify router does not forward traffic
5. Load valid startup configuration
6. Verify router boots up successfully
```

Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the unit tests! Here is an example unit test plan for the bootup process on an MX480 router, with test cases in markdown format:

## Test Plan for MX480 Router Bootup Process

### Test Case 1 - Cold Boot

**Setup:**
- Power off the MX480 router
- Ensure console access to the router

**Execution:** 
1. Power on the MX480 router
2. Monitor the console as it boots up

**Verification:**
- Verify all expected hardware components are detected during POST
- Verify Junos OS boots up successfully 
- Verify routing engine transitions to master and line cards come online
- Verify no errors or failures during the boot process

**Teardown:**
- Power off the MX480 router

### Test Case 2 - Reboot

**Setup:** 
- Ensure MX480 router is powered on and fully booted into Junos OS
- Establish console access 

**Execution:**
1. Issue the `request system reboot` command to reboot the router
2. Monitor the console during the reboot process

**Verification:**
- Verify the system shuts down services properly before rebooting
- Verify the router goes through normal reboot process with POST
- Confirm Junos OS boots up successfully
- Make sure routing engines transition master role properly
- Check line cards come online without issues
  
**Teardown:**
- None

### Test Case 3 - GRES Boot 

**Setup:** 
- Start with MX480 running on master routing engine 
- Establish console connection to backup routing engine  

**Execution:**
1. Issue `request chassis routing-engine master switch`  
2. Monitor console of new master as it boots up

**Verification:** 
- Verify GRES switchover occurs successfully
- Confirm backup routing engine boots up properly into master
- Check all services come online correctly on new master
  
**Teardown:**
- None Unfortunately I do not have the specifics of the MX480 bootup process or Python unit tests for it. As an AI assistant without direct access to device technical details or code, I cannot provide markdown output for Python unit tests for a specific device bootup process. I can, however, provide a general template for how Python unit tests may be structured for testing a device bootup process:

```python
import unittest

class TestBootup(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_power_on(self):
        # Test powering on the device
        self.assertTrue(device.is_powered_on()) 

    def test_bios_post(self):
        # Test BIOS power-on self-test
        self.assertTrue(device.bios.post_passed())

    def test_bootloader(self):
        # Test bootloader initialization 
        self.assertTrue(device.bootloader.initialized())

    def test_kernel_load(self): 
        # Test kernel loading
        self.assertTrue(device.kernel.loaded())

    def test_kernel_init(self):
        # Test kernel initialization
        self.assertTrue(device.kernel.initialized()) 

    def test_services_start(self):
        # Test start of essential services
        self.assertTrue(device.services.running())

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

This tests some common high-level components of a bootup sequence, like power on, BIOS POST, bootloader, kernel loading, kernel and service initialization. But without specifics on the MX480 architecture and bootup components, I cannot provide an accurate test implementation. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional details to provide. Here is an example unit test for the bootup process on an MX480 router to verify configuration in markdown format:

```markdown
# MX480 Router Bootup Configuration Verification Test

## Test Setup

- Router model: Juniper MX480
- Junos version: Junos 21.3R1.10   
- Test interfaces: ge-0/0/0, ge-0/0/1

## Test Steps

1. Power on the MX480 router
2. Verify Junos bootup messages are displayed correctly without errors
3. Verify interfaces ge-0/0/0 and ge-0/0/1 come up properly 
   ```
   *Feb 12 12:01:23 router1 interfaces ge-0/0/0 link status up
   *Feb 12 12:01:23 router1 interfaces ge-0/0/1 link status up```
4. Verify default route is installed
   ```
   *Feb 12 12:01:30 router1 routing protocol BGP route install: 0.0.0.0/0
   ``` 
5. Verify SNMP traps are enabled
   ```
   *Feb 12 12:01:45 router1 SNMP trap group default enabled 
   ```
6. Verify system services have started
   ```
   *Feb 12 12:02:00 router1 system services initialized
   ```
7. Verify committed configuration was loaded properly
   ```
   *Feb 12 12:02:30 router1 configuration loaded from flash 
   ```

## Test Outcome

- All test steps passed successfully
- MX480 router bootup process functions properly with committed configuration
```

This covers the major points to validate during the bootup process like verifying the boot messages, interfaces status, routing protocol routes installed, SNMP traps enabled, system services started and configuration loaded from storage. The timestamp output provides logging details to check order and timing.
