 Here are some example unit tests for bootup process cases for the Juniper Networks MX480 router in markdown format:

## Test Bootup with valid config

**Given** the router is powered off

**When** the router is powered on with a valid boot config

**Then** 
- The POWER LED should turn green
- The STATUS LED should turn green
- All interface LEDs should turn green indicating ports are up
- The router should load the valid config and boot up successfully

**And** the router should be reachable via SSH

## Test Bootup with invalid config

**Given** the router is powered off  

**When** the router is powered on with an invalid boot config

**Then** 
- The POWER LED should turn green
- The STATUS LED should turn red
- The router should fail to load the invalid config

**And** the router should be reachable via console port

**And** an appropriate error message should be logged indicating failed boot

## Test Bootup with corrupted boot loader

**Given** the router is powered off

**When** the router is powered on with a corrupted boot loader

**Then** 
- The POWER LED should turn green
- The STATUS LED should turn red
- A boot interrupt error should be displayed on the console

**And** the router should enter safe mode for system recovery

Let me know if you need any other details or have additional test cases to cover! Here is an example unit test plan for the bootup process on an MX480 router, with test cases formatted in Markdown:

## Test Plan - MX480 Router Bootup

### Test Setup
- Physical MX480 router
- Console cable connected to router
- Terminal emulator connected via console cable

### Test Case 1 - Power On Self Test

**Description:** Verify power on self test completes successfully

**Setup:**
- Power off router 
- Connect console cable to router
- Open terminal emulator 

**Execution Steps:**
1. Power on the router
2. Verify console displays boot messages and POST completes successfully without errors

**Verification:**
- Console logs show boot messages
- POST completes without errors

**Teardown:**
- None

### Test Case 2 - Bootloader Initialization 

**Description:** Verify bootloader initializes properly

**Setup:** 
- Router powered off after test case 1

**Execution Steps:**
1. Power on the router
2. Verify console shows "Booting flash..." message
3. Verify console shows bootloader version

**Verification:**
- Console shows expected bootloader initialization messages
- Correct bootloader version is displayed 

**Teardown:**
- None

### Test Case 3 - Kernel Initialization

**Description:** Verify Linux kernel initializes properly

**Setup:**
- Router powered off after test case 2

**Execution Steps:** 
1. Power on the router 
2. Verify console shows "Linux version" details

**Verification:** 
- Console shows expected Linux kernel version 

**Teardown:**
- Power off router

Let me know if you need any other details or have additional test cases to cover! Unfortunately I do not have the details on the specific bootup process for the MX480 device to provide a Python unit test for it. As an AI assistant without direct access to technical documentation or code, I don't have enough context to generate an accurate unit test. However, I can provide a general template for how a Python unit test for a bootup process might be structured:

```python
import unittest

class TestMX480Bootup(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_bios_initialization(self):
        # Test BIOS initialization steps
        self.assertEqual(bios_version, "1.0.2") 
        self.assertTrue(memory_self_test_passed)
        
    def test_bootloader_load(self):
        # Test bootloader loading 
        self.assertEqual(bootloader_name, "GRUB")
        self.assertEqual(bootloader_version, "0.97")
        
    def test_kernel_load(self): 
        # Test Linux kernel loading
        self.assertEqual(kernel_version, "4.15.0-36-generic") 
        self.assertTrue(kernel_integrity_check_passed)

    def test_init_process(self):
        # Check critical system init processes started
        self.assertTrue(process_running("systemd"))  
        self.assertTrue(process_running("dbus"))
        
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

This tests some common things like:

- BIOS initialization steps  
- Bootloader loading properly 
- Linux kernel version and integrity check 
- Critical system processes starting

I tried to provide a general structure that tests key phases of the boot process. Hopefully this gives you a template to build upon even without specifics for the MX480 device. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions! Here is an example unit test for the bootup process on an MX480 router to verify configuration in markdown format:

# MX480 Router Bootup Configuration Verification Test

## Test Setup

- Router model: Juniper MX480
- JunOS version: 19.2R1.9  
- Test interfaces: 
  - ge-0/0/0 (connected to test traffic generator)
  - ge-0/0/1 (connected to traffic analyzer)

## Test Steps

1. Power on the MX480 router
2. Verify JunOS version with `show version` 
3. Verify default routing configuration
    ``` 
    show configuration routing-options
    ```
4. Verify interfaces ge-0/0/0 and ge-0/0/1 are up   
    ```
    show interfaces terse 
    ```
5. Send test traffic between ge-0/0/0 and ge-0/0/1
    - 100 Mbps UDP traffic
    - 1024 byte packets
    - Traffic duration: 5 minutes
6. Verify no packet loss during test traffic

## Expected Results  

- Router boots up successfully to JunOS 19.2R1.9
- Routing options configuration matches default values 
- Interfaces ge-0/0/0 and ge-0/0/1 status = up
- No packet loss during 5 minute 100 Mbps UDP traffic test

## Test Result

- PASS/FAIL
- Details of any failed test steps

## Conclusion  

Statement of overall test pass or fail status after running through all test steps and results.
