 Here are some example unit test cases for bootup process testing on the Juniper Networks MX480 router:

## Test Cases for MX480 Router Bootup

### TC1 - Perform clean reboot 
- Step 1: Console into the router CLI as admin user
- Step 2: Issue `request system reboot` command  
- Step 3: Verify console prints reboot messages, kernel initialization messages, system daemons starting, etc.
- Step 4: Verify routing protocol neighbors converge, interfaces show up/up status, system ready message prints

### TC2 - Reboot single Routing Engine
- Step 1: Console into router, issue `request chassis routing-engine master reboot`  
- Step 2: Verify secondary Routing Engine takes over as master, system stabilizes with protocols converged 
- Step 3: Verify old master boots up properly into standby state

### TC3 - Power cycle single Routing Engine 
- Step 1: Power cycle RE in slot 0 by physically removing and reinserting card
- Step 2: Verify secondary RE takes over without issues, system protocols converge
- Step 3: Verify old master boots properly into standby  

### TC4 - Perform safe-reboot
- Step 1: Console in and issue `request system reboot safe-reboot` 
- Step 2: Verify reboot process is slow and graceful, system dumps core files
- Step 3: Verify system boots up normally after safe reboot 

### TC5 - Reboot with GRES enabled
- Step 1: Enable GRES, console into primary RE 
- Step 2: Issue `request chassis routing-engine master reboot`
- Step 3: Verify session persistence across GRES switchover
- Step 4: Verify old master comes up properly into standby state

Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional test cases to be covered! Here is an example unit test plan for the bootup process on an MX480 router, in markdown format:

## Test Plan for MX480 Router Bootup

### Test Case 1 - Cold Boot

**Setup:**
- Power off the MX480 router
- Connect console cable to router
- Open terminal emulator and connect to console

**Execution:** 
- Power on the MX480 router
- Observe boot messages on console

**Verification:**
- Verify BIOS POST messages are displayed
- Verify Junos kernel boot messages are displayed 
- Verify all critical services like routing protocols have started properly 
- Verify no errors or failure messages  

**Teardown:**
- Keep router running 

### Test Case 2 - Fast Reboot

**Setup:**
- MX480 router powered on and running
- Connect console cable to router secondary console port
- Open second terminal emulator and connect 

**Execution:**
- Issue `request system reboot` command on primary console to trigger fast reboot
- Observe console on secondary terminal during reboot

**Verification:** 
- Verify fast reboot time is less than typical cold boot time
- Verify all processes restart properly 
- Verify no failure or crash messages

**Teardown:**
- Disconnect extra console session

### Test Case 3 - Safe Mode Boot 

**Setup:** 
- Power off MX480 router

**Execution:**
- Power on router, press ESC key repeatedly to enter safe mode
- Observe safe mode boot messages  

**Verification:**
- Verify enters safe mode with minimal processes running
- Verify only basic configuration loaded
- Verify can exit safe mode to full boot  

**Teardown:**
- Reboot router back to normal mode

Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional test cases to cover! Unfortunately I do not have access to the specific technical details or source code to provide a detailed Python unit test for the bootup process of the Juniper MX480 router. However, here is an example of what a high-level Python unit test may look like for testing the bootup functionality in Markdown format:

```python
import unittest
from router import MX480

class TestMX480Bootup(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_bootup(self):
        """Test MX480 bootup process completes successfully"""
        router = MX480()
        router.power_on()

        # Check basic bootup steps 
        self.assertEqual(router.status, "BOOTING")  
        self.assertIn("Loading kernel", router.console)
        self.assertIn("Starting system services", router.console)

        # Check routing engine status
        self.assertEqual(router.re_status[0], "ACTIVE") 
        self.assertEqual(router.re_status[1], "STANDBY")

        # Check control plane protocols
        self.assertTrue(router.bgp_established) 
        self.assertTrue(router.ospf_neighbors_up)

        # Check data plane 
        self.assertTrue(router.forwarding_engine_ready)

        # Check successful final status
        self.assertEqual(router.status, "READY")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

This tests some key aspects of the boot process by:

- Powering on the router 
- Checking console output for key boot stages
- Checking routing engine state 
- Checking control plane protocol status
- Checking data plane readiness 
- Verifying final status is READY

Additional tests could be added for specific hardware/firmware checks, negative tests, etc. But this provides a basic example structure for testing the MX480 bootup with Python's unittest framework and some stubbed router methods. Here is an example unit test for the bootup process on an MX480 router to verify configuration in markdown format:

# MX480 Router Bootup Configuration Verification

## Test Setup

- Router model: Juniper MX480 
- Junos version: Junos OS Release 20.3R1
- Test date: January 1, 2023

## Test Steps

1. Power on the MX480 router
2. Verify the LED status indicators light up correctly during boot 
3. Check console output during bootup:
    ```
    Verifying configuration
    Verified manifest signed by Juniper
    Checking FRU ID...OK
    Power on Self Test PASS
   Loading Junos version...OK
   ```
4. Validate boot time within expected limit (<5 mins)
5. Check interface status shows all interfaces up after completion of boot 
6. Verify valid IP connectivity by pinging known destinations
7. Validate routing tables populated correctly
8. Check system logs and event messages for any errors or warnings 

## Test Result

- All test steps completed successfully
- MX480 router booted up properly
- Routers components and Junos OS working as expected
- Configuration verified with no issues 

## Verdict

PASS

The test has verified correct functioning of MX480 router during bootup process and validated configuration as per specifications.
