 Here are some unit test cases for the bootup process of the Juniper Networks MX480 router in markdown format:

# Unit Test Cases for MX480 Router Bootup

## Test Case 1 - Power On Self Test

**Description:** Validate that the power on self test (POST) completes successfully when the router is powered on.

**Steps:**  

1. Power off the MX480 router
2. Power on the MX480 router
3. Verify console logs show POST completing successfully without any errors or failures

**Expected Result:** POST completes successfully without any errors or failures

## Test Case 2 - Boot Loader Initialization 

**Description:** Validate that the boot loader is able to locate the junos OS kernel and initialize successfully.

**Steps:**

1. Power on the MX480 router
2. Verify console logs show boot loader locating junos kernel and performing initialization without errors

**Expected Result:** Boot loader initialization completes successfully without any errors or failures

## Test Case 3 - Junos OS Bootup

**Description:** Validate that Junos OS is able to boot completely when loaded by the boot loader.

**Steps:**

1. Power on the MX480 router
2. Verify console logs show Junos kernel booting up, mounting file systems, loading configuration and completing daemon initialization without errors  

**Expected Result:** Junos OS bootup completes successfully without any errors or failures  and router prompts ready for use

## Test Case 4 - Component Initialization

**Description:** Validate initialization of key router components like Routing Engine, Switch Fabric, Line Cards etc.

**Steps:** 

1. Power on MX480 router
2. Verify component initialization messages in console for Routing Engines, Switch Fabric Cards, Line Cards
3. Verify operational status of components shows active without any failures

**Expected Result:** All router components initialize without any errors and show status as active Here is an example unit test plan for the bootup process on an MX480 router, with test cases in markdown format:

## Test Plan for MX480 Router Bootup

### Test Case 1 - Cold Boot

**Setup:**

- Power off the MX480 router
- Connect console cable to console port
- Open terminal emulator and connect to console

**Execution:**

1. Power on the MX480 router
2. Verify console prints the boot messages including:
    - Power on self test
    - Loading kernel
    - Mounting file systems
    - Starting system processes and daemons

**Verification:**

- Console prints expected boot messages
- Router finishes booting and prompt is available 

**Teardown:**

- Power off the router
- Disconnect console cable

### Test Case 2 - Warm Boot

**Setup:** 

- Connect to MX480 over SSH while powered on

**Execution:**

1. Issue `request system reboot` command 
2. Reconnect SSH session once router is backup
3. Verify routing engine redundancy status

**Verification:**

- Router reboots and SSH session reconnects 
- Routing engines show master and backup status as expected

**Teardown:**

- None

### Test Case 3 - GR Recovery Boot

**Setup:**

- Connect console cable to powered on MX480
- Gracefully halt the master routing engine 

**Execution:** 

1. Verify console prints messages about master routing engine going down
2. Verify backup routing engine takes over as new master
3. Verify backup routing engine comes up fully with expected boot messages

**Verification:**

- Console prints expected failover messages
- New master routing engine finishes booting properly

**Teardown:**

- Recover master routing engine
- Disconnect console cable Unfortunately I do not have the details or code to provide a Python unit test for the bootup process of the MX480. The MX480 is a Juniper Networks router, and creating a detailed Python unit test would require internal knowledge of the router's software and boot process that is not publicly available. 

However, I can provide a high-level example of what such a Python unit test may look like in markdown format:

```python
import unittest
from router import MX480

class TestMX480Bootup(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_bootup(self):
        # Create MX480 router object
        router = MX480()
        
        # Check basic bootup steps
        self.assertEqual(router.status, "POWERING_ON")  
        self.assertEqual(router.status, "LOADING_BOOTLOADER")
        self.assertEqual(router.status, "LOADING_KERNEL")
        self.assertEqual(router.status, "LOADING_MODULES")
        self.assertEqual(router.status, "COMPLETED_BOOTUP")
        
        # Check diagnostic info
        self.assertGreater(router.diagnostic["memory"], 0) 
        self.assertGreater(router.diagnostic["cpu_count"], 0)
        self.assertRegex(router.diagnostic["boot_log"], ".*boot success.*")
        
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

This simply mocks some basic boot steps and diagnostics data to check in the unit test. A complete test would likely need to validate many more technical details of the actual boot process. Here is an example unit test for the bootup process on an MX480 router to verify configuration in markdown format:

# MX480 Router Bootup Configuration Verification Test

## Test Setup

- Router model: Juniper MX480 
- Junos version: Junos 21.3R1.10
- Test interfaces: ge-0/0/0, ge-0/0/1

## Test Steps

1. Power on the MX480 router
2. Verify Junos version after bootup

    ```
    root@MX480> show version 
    Junos: 21.3R1.10
    ```

3. Verify default configuration

    ```
    root@MX480> show configuration 
    ```

    - Verify all interfaces are operationally down
    - Verify root authentication is configured
    - Verify SNMP, NTP are not configured
    
4. Configure 2 test interfaces

    ```
    set interfaces ge-0/0/0 unit 0 family inet address 192.168.1.1/24
    set interfaces ge-0/0/1 unit 0 family inet address 10.0.10.1/24 
    ```

5. Commit configuration

6. Verify interfaces ge-0/0/0 and ge-0/0/1 are operationally up

    ```
    root@MX480> show interfaces terse
    Interface               Admin Link Proto    Local                 Remote
    ge-0/0/0                up    up
    ge-0/0/1                up    up
    ```

## Test Result

- Router booted up properly with base Junos configuration
- Verified correct Junos version after reboot 
- Able to commit and verify test interface configuration

**Test Passed**
