**Steps:**

1. Power on the MX480 router
2. Interrupt normal boot by pressing space bar during POST
3. Load boot loader
4. Verify boot loader prompt is displayed

**Expected Result:**  

- Boot loader prompt is displayed after loading boot loader

### TC3 - Load Junos OS 

**Description:** Verify Junos OS loads successfully

**Steps:**

1. From boot loader prompt, load Junos OS
2. Verify Junos OS boot messages are printed to console 
3. Verify Junos OS CLI prompt is displayed after boot process completes

**Expected Result:**

- Junos OS boot messages are printed to console
- Junos CLI prompt is displayed after Junos OS loads successfully

### TC4 - Reboot router

**Description:** Verify router reboots successfully

**Steps:** 

1. From Junos OS CLI prompt, issue `request system reboot` command
2. Verify console prints reboot messages
3. Verify router boots back into Junos OS with CLI prompt

**Expected Result:**

- Console prints system reboot messages
- Router boots back into Junos OS with CLI prompt Here are some example unit tests for the bootup process on an MX480 router in markdown format:

## Test Bootup Process

### Test Case 1 - Cold Boot

**Setup**:

- Power off the MX480 completely
- Connect console cable to console port 

**Execution**:

- Power on the MX480

**Verification**:

- Verify boot messages are printed on the console
- Verify the system boots up successfully to operational mode

**Teardown**:

- Power off the MX480

### Test Case 2 - Warm Boot

**Setup**: 

- Ensure MX480 is powered on and in operational mode
- Connect console cable to console port

**Execution**:

- From operational mode, issue `request system reboot` 

**Verification**:

- Verify boot messages are printed on the console 
- Verify the system reboots successfully back to operational mode

**Teardown**:

- None

### Test Case 3 - Rescue Boot 

**Setup**:

- Power on MX480 
- Interrupt normal boot by pressing space bar at console

**Execution**: 

- At boot menu, select the rescue kernel option

**Verification**:

- Verify rescue kernel boots up to rescue prompt
- Verify filesystems are mounted read-only

**Teardown**: 

- From rescue prompt, issue `reboot` to restart normal boot process Here is a sample Python unit test for the bootup process of an MX480 router, in markdown format:

```python
import unittest
from router import MX480

class TestMX480Bootup(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_bootup(self):
        """Test MX480 bootup process"""
        
        # Create MX480 router object
        router = MX480()
        
        # Verify components initialize correctly
        self.assertEqual(router.mode, "Operational")
        self.assertTrue(router.power_supply.status == "OK")
        self.assertTrue(router.fan_tray.status == "OK")
        
        # Verify bootup self-tests pass
        self.assertTrue(router.diag_self_test())
        
        # Verify FPCs come online 
        for fpc in router.fpcs:
            self.assertEqual(fpc.status, "Online")
            
        # Verify Routing Engine redundancy
        self.assertEqual(len(router.routing_engines), 2)
        self.assertEqual(router.re_status(), "Master RE synced")
        
        # Verify protocols and services initialize
        self.assertTrue(router.bgp.established)
        self.assertTrue(router.ospf.established) 
        self.assertTrue(router.ssh_service.running)
        
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

This test creates a MX480 router object and steps through the key components of the bootup process, verifying that:

- The router initializes in operational mode
- Power and fan modules are OK 
- Self-tests pass
- FPCs come online
- Routing Engines redundancy is established
- Key routing protocols and services start

The assert methods are used to check expected state at each step. This provides a basic framework for validating the router bootup and configuration. Additional tests could be added for specific features or protocols. Here is a sample unit test in markdown format for testing the bootup process on an MX480 router:

# Bootup Process Test for MX480 Router

## Test Setup

- Router model: MX480
- Junos version: Junos OS Release 20.3R1
- Test interfaces: ge-0/0/0, ge-0/0/1

## Test Steps

1. Power on the MX480 router and connect to the console port
2. Verify the bootup messages and that the system boots to operational mode
3. Execute `show version` and verify Junos version
4. Execute `show chassis hardware` and verify hardware components
5. Execute `show interfaces terse` and verify interfaces are up
6. Execute `show configuration` and verify base configuration

## Test Validation

- Router booted to operational mode successfully
- Junos version is as expected
- Correct hardware components displayed
- Test interfaces ge-0/0/0 and ge-0/0/1 are up
- Base configuration loaded as expected

## Test Result

- PASS. MX480 router bootup successful and configuration validated.

## Test Cleanup 

- No cleanup steps necessary
