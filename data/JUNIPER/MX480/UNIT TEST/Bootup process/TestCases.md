 Here are some example unit tests for bootup process cases for the Juniper Networks MX480 router in markdown format:

## Bootup Process Unit Tests

### Test Bootup with Valid Configuration

- Load a valid router configuration file
- Power on the router 
- Verify the router boots up successfully 
- Verify the correct firmware version is running
- Verify all expected interfaces are up
- Verify all control plane protocols have converged (OSPF, BGP etc)

### Test Bootup with Invalid Configuration 

- Load an invalid router configuration file with errors
- Power on the router
- Verify the router detects errors on bootup 
- Verify the router boots to safe mode and rejects the invalid config

### Test Bootup with Corrupted Firmware

- Load a firmware image that has been corrupted
- Power on the router
- Verify bootup fails with an error indicating corrupted firmware
- Verify router loads backup firmware and boots up

### Test Bootup with Minimum Hardware

- Boot router with only minimum required hardware components
- Verify router is able to boot up successfully
- Verify all expected base functionality works

### Test Bootup with Faulty Hardware

- Introduce a faulty hardware component like bad RAM
- Attempt to boot the router 
- Verify bootup fails due to hardware fault
- Replace faulty component and verify successful bootup Here are some example unit test cases for the bootup process on an MX480 router in Markdown format:

## Test Cases for MX480 Bootup Process

**Teardown:** 
- None

### TC3 - Power Failure Boot 

**Setup:**
- MX480 router powered on and operational

**Execution:**

- Verify console prints "Bootstrap passed" on power restoration
- Verify "System ready" prompt appears indicating successful boot after power restore

**Teardown:**
- None Here is a detailed Python unit test for the bootup process of the Juniper MX480 router in markdown format:

```python
import unittest
from netmiko import ConnectHandler

class TestMX480Bootup(unittest.TestCase):
    
    def setUp(self):
        self.mx480 = {
            'device_type': 'juniper',
            'ip': '192.168.1.1',
            'username': 'juniper',
            'password': 'juniper123'
        }
        
    def test_console_access(self):
        net_connect = ConnectHandler(**self.mx480)
        output = net_connect.send_command('show version')
        self.assertIn('Junos:', output)
        
    def test_routing_engine_status(self):
        net_connect = ConnectHandler(**self.mx480)
        output = net_connect.send_command('show chassis routing-engine')
        self.assertIn('Current state', output)
        self.assertIn('Master', output)
        
    def test_linecard_status(self):
        net_connect = ConnectHandler(**self.mx480)
        output = net_connect.send_command('show chassis fpc')  
        for line in output.splitlines():
            if 'Slot' in line:
                slot_num = line.split()[1]
            if 'Online' in line:
                status = line.split()[2]
                self.assertEqual(status, 'Online')
                
    def test_interface_status(self):
        net_connect = ConnectHandler(**self.mx480)
        output = net_connect.send_command('show interfaces terse')
        for line in output.splitlines():
            int_status = line.split()[3]
            self.assertIn(int_status, ['up', 'down'])
            
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

This test checks basic bootup validation like:

- Console access using netmiko
- Routing engine status 
- Linecard status
- Interface status

It uses netmiko library to connect to the device and executes show commands to validate the bootup. The test cases assert the expected bootup behavior. Here is a sample unit test in markdown format for verifying the bootup process on an MX480 router:

## Test Bootup Process on MX480 Router

### Test Setup

- Router model: MX480
- Router hostname: mx480-1
- OS version: Junos 19.2R1.9   

### Test Steps

1. Power on the MX480 router and connect to the console port
2. Verify the boot sequence:

    ```
    UEFI Interactive Shell v2.2
    EDK II
    UEFI v2.70 (EDK II, 0x00010000)
    Mapping table
           FS0: Alias(s):HD0a1:;BLK1:
               PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1,0x1)/Sata(0x0,0xFFFF,0x0)
    Press ESC in 1 seconds to skip startup.nsh or any other key to continue.
    ```

3. Interrupt the boot sequence by pressing a key when prompted

4. Verify the system POST:

    ```
    POS Table Size = 0x00000bb8
    Initialize SMBIOS Table...

    Memory Detected: 32768MB

    Test Passed.
    ```

5. Allow the router to complete booting

6. Verify the Junos OS boot sequence:

    ```
    ...
    FreeBSD/RISC-V U-Boot 64-bit

    Hit [Enter] to boot immediately, or any other key for command shell
    
    Booting kernel in 9 seconds...   
    Loading /bsd......
    Initializing MX SCB
    Determining if MX SCB recovery is needed...

    No SCB recovery needed.

    Hit [Enter] to boot immediately, or any other key for command shell.
    Booting...

    [ output truncated]

    Junos 19.2R1.9 Kernel 64-bit  JNPR-11.0-20191217.f0321ff_buil
    ```

7. Log into the CLI and verify the hostname:

    ```
    user@host> show hostame 
    mx480-1
    ```

### Test Result

- Bootup process completed successfully 
- Junos OS version verified as 19.2R1.9
- Hostname verified as configured

The unit test passed.
