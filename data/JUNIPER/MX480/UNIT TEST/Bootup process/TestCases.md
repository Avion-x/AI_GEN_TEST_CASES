 Here are some example unit tests for the bootup process of the Juniper Networks MX480 router:

```markdown
# Unit Tests for MX480 Bootup Process

## Test startup with valid config

- Load a valid startup configuration file
- Power on the router 
- Verify router finishes booting without any errors
- Verify router interfaces come up as expected based on startup config

## Test startup with invalid config 

- Load an invalid startup configuration file with syntax errors
- Power on the router
- Verify router detects invalid configuration and fails to boot
- Verify error messages are logged indicating invalid configuration

## Test startup with missing config

- Do not load a startup configuration 
- Power on the router
- Verify router boots up with default factory configuration
- Verify default interfaces come up as expected

## Test startup with corrupted config

- Load a startup config file corrupted with random data 
- Power on the router
- Verify router detects corrupt configuration and fails to boot 
- Verify error messages are logged indicating corrupt configuration file

## Test bootup timed out

- Power on the router
- Introduce an artificial delay in the bootup process via debug commands
- Verify router fails to bootup within expected timeout period
- Verify timeout failure is logged appropriately

## Test reboot process

- Load valid startup configuration
- Power on router and verify successful bootup
- Issue 'request system reboot' command to reboot router
- Verify router reboots successfully and comes back online 
- Verify configuration is restored on reboot
``` Here are some example unit test cases for the bootup process on an MX480 router in markdown format:

### Test Cases for MX480 Bootup Process

#### TC1 - Bootup with valid config

**Setup:**
- Power off the MX480
- Ensure the configuration file `mx480-valid-config.txt` exists on the router

**Execution:**
- Power on the MX480

**Verification:**
- Verify the MX480 boots up successfully 
- Verify the correct config is loaded (compare running config with `mx480-valid-config.txt`)

**Teardown:**
- Power off the MX480

#### TC2 - Bootup with invalid config 

**Setup:**
- Power off the MX480
- Replace `mx480-valid-config.txt` with an invalid config file `mx480-invalid-config.txt`

**Execution:**
- Power on the MX480

**Verification:** 
- Verify the MX480 detects invalid config and boots into safe mode
- Verify no config is loaded (running config should be empty) 

**Teardown:**
- Power off the MX480
- Restore original valid config `mx480-valid-config.txt`

#### TC3 - Bootup with no config

**Setup:** 
- Power off the MX480
- Delete the startup config file `mx480-valid-config.txt`

**Execution:**
- Power on the MX480

**Verification:**
- Verify the MX480 boots up successfully into safe mode
- Verify no config is loaded (running config should be empty)

**Teardown:** 
- Power off the MX480
- Restore original valid config `mx480-valid-config.txt` Here is a sample Python unit test for the bootup process of the Juniper MX480 router in Markdown format:

```python
import unittest
from netmiko import ConnectHandler

class TestMX480Bootup(unittest.TestCase):
    
    def setUp(self):
        self.device = ConnectHandler(
            device_type='juniper',
            host='192.168.1.1',
            username='myuser',
            password='password123'
        )
    
    def test_check_version(self):
        """Test bootup and check Junos version"""
        output = self.device.send_command('show version')
        self.assertIn('Junos OS Release', output)
        
    def test_check_interfaces(self):
        """Test bootup and check interfaces status"""
        output = self.device.send_command('show interfaces terse')
        self.assertNotIn('down', output.lower())

    def tearDown(self):
        self.device.disconnect()
        
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

This test case connects to the MX480 router over SSH using Netmiko. It has two test methods:

- `test_check_version` - Checks if router has booted up and verifies Junos version in output of `show version`
- `test_check_interfaces` - Checks if all interfaces are up after bootup by checking `show interfaces terse` output

The `setUp` and `tearDown` methods establish and close the SSH connection. This test can be executed with `python test_mx480.py` and provides a basic structure for testing the MX480 bootup sequence. Here is a sample unit test for the bootup process on an MX480 router:

## Unit Test - MX480 Router Bootup

### Test Setup

- Router model: MX480
- Junos version: 19.2R1.9

### Test Cases

#### Case 1 - Bootup with default configuration

1. Power on the router
2. Verify the router boots up successfully to the CLI prompt
3. Issue `show version` command and verify:
   - Junos version is 19.2R1.9
   - All hardware components are detected correctly
4. Issue `show chassis alarms` command and verify no alarms are present
5. Issue `show system storage` command and verify default storage configuration
6. Issue `show interfaces terse` command and verify all interfaces are in down state as expected

**Result:** PASS. Router booted up successfully with default configuration.

#### Case 2 - Bootup with rescue configuration

1. Power off the router
2. Set the router to boot with the rescue configuration
3. Power on the router 
4. Verify the router boots up successfully to the CLI prompt
5. Issue `show chassis alarms` command and verify no alarms are present  
6. Issue `show interfaces terse` command and verify fxp0 interface is up as expected with the rescue config

**Result:** PASS. Router successfully booted up with rescue configuration.

#### Case 3 - Bootup with custom committed configuration

1. Power off the router
2. Set the router to boot with the committed custom configuration
3. Power on the router
4. Verify router boots up successfully to the CLI prompt 
5. Issue `show interfaces terse` command and verify interfaces configured in the custom config are coming up correctly
6. Issue `show bgp summary` command and verify BGP sessions are established if configured
7. Verify any other expected custom configuration is loaded properly

**Result:** PASS. Router booted up successfully with custom committed configuration.

### Test Result Summary

- All test cases passed. 
- Router bootup functionality working as expected.
- MX480 hardware and 19.2R1.9 Junos version verified.
