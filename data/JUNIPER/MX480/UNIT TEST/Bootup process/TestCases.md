 Here is sample unit test cases for bootup process for Juniper Networks MX480 router in markdown format:

## Test Cases for MX480 Router Bootup Process

### TC1 - Power on Router

**Steps:**

1. Connect power cables to the router 
2. Turn on power switches to power on the router
3. Verify power LED turns green on craft interface
4. Verify fans speed up and LEDs on craft interface light up

**Expected Result:**
Router boots up and completes POST.

### TC2 - Verify Boot Messages 

**Steps:**

1. Connect console cable to console port on router
2. Capture console logs during boot up process

**Expected Result:**
- Boot messages are printed on console indicating component initialization 
- No errors reported
- Login prompt is displayed at end of boot 

### TC3 - Load Boot Code

**Steps:**

1. Allow router to complete entire boot process
2. Verify `JUNOS` boot code is loaded 

**Expected Result:**
- `JUNOS` version string is displayed during boot messages
- Router boots into JUNOS OS and displays login prompt

### TC4 - Boot into Rescue Configuration

**Steps:** 

1. Interrupt normal boot process to enter boot loader mode
2. Issue command `boot rescue` at boot loader prompt

**Expected Result:** 
- Router boots into rescue configuration mode
- Rescue configuration mode confirmed from console prompt

### TC5 - Recover from Rescue Mode 

**Steps:**

1. Boot router into rescue configuration mode
2. Issue `request system reboot` command at rescue prompt

**Expected Result:**
- Router reboots and loads normal Junos OS configuration
- Login prompt for Junos OS shell displayed after reboot Here are some sample unit test cases for the bootup process on an MX480 router in markdown format:

## Test Cases for MX480 Bootup Process

### TC1 - Cold Boot

**Setup:** Power off the MX480 router completely.

**Execution:** Press the power button to turn on the router. 

**Verification:**

- Fans spin up to high speed momentarily then slow down.
- Console displays booting messages including:
  - BIOS information
  - Loading kernel
  - Starting init process
  - Running fsck
  - Mounting filesystems 
  - Starting system services
  - Reach multi-user target
- Login prompt displays on console indicating successful boot.

**Teardown:** None

### TC2 - Reboot

**Setup:** MX480 powered on with no configuration changes.

**Execution:** Issue `reboot` command.

**Verification:**
- Console displays shutdown messages as services stop.
- Router reboots, goes through bootup process.
- Login prompt displays indicating reboot completed successfully.

**Teardown:** None

### TC3 - Power Failure

**Setup:** MX480 powered on and idle. 

**Execution:** Cut power to MX480 by unplugging power cables. 

**Verification:**
- Router immediately powers off.
- Plug power cables back in. 
- Router boots up normally through entire bootup process.

**Teardown:** None

### TC4 - Corrupted Kernel

**Setup:** Rename kernel on flash to `kernel.corrupt`.

**Execution:** Reboot MX480.

**Verification:** 
- Fails to load kernel, panic message displayed.
- Automatically reverts to backup kernel.
- Boots up successfully with backup kernel.

**Teardown:** Rename kernel back to `kernel`. Here is a markdown formatted Python unit test for the bootup process of the Juniper MX480 router:

```python
import unittest
from netmiko import ConnectHandler

class TestMX480Bootup(unittest.TestCase):
    
    def setUp(self):
        """Set up the test configuration"""
        self.device = {
            'device_type': 'juniper',

            'username': 'pyuser',
            'password': 'pypass',
        }
        
    def test_console_access(self):
        """Test console access to MX480"""
        net_connect = ConnectHandler(**self.device)
        output = net_connect.send_command("show version")
        
        self.assertIn("Junos OS", output)
        
    def test_routing_engine_bootup(self):
        """Test RE bootup process"""
        net_connect = ConnectHandler(**self.device)

        self.assertIn("Last reboot reason", output)
        
    def test_linecard_initialization(self):

        net_connect = ConnectHandler(**self.device)
        
        output = net_connect.send_command("show chassis fpc")
        
        for fpc in range(0,5):
            self.assertIn(f"FPC{fpc}", output)
            self.assertIn("Online", output)
            
    def test_interface_status(self):
        """Test interface operational status""" 
        net_connect = ConnectHandler(**self.device)
        
        output = net_connect.send_command("show interfaces terse")
        
        self.assertIn("xe-0/0/0", output)
        self.assertIn("up", output)
        self.assertIn("xe-0/0/1", output)
        self.assertIn("down", output)
        
    def tearDown(self):
        """Disconnect from device"""
        net_connect.disconnect()
        
if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

This test covers some key aspects of the MX480 bootup process:

- Connecting to console 
- Checking RE boot status
- Validating MPC initialization 
- Verifying interface status

Each test method focuses on a specific aspect and makes assertions to validate the expected state. The setUp and tearDown methods take care of creating the device connection and closing it afterwards. Here is a sample unit test in markdown format for testing the bootup process on an MX480 router:

## Unit Test: MX480 Router Bootup

### Test Objective

Verify that the MX480 router boots up properly and runs initial diagnostics.
