 Here are some example unit tests for the bootup process of the Juniper Networks MX480 router:

```markdown
# Unit Tests for MX480 Bootup Process

## Test Bootup with Valid Configuration

- Load valid startup configuration file
- Power on device
- Verify device boots up successfully 
- Verify correct hostname is set
- Verify all expected interfaces are up
- Verify all routing protocols come up correctly

## Test Bootup with Invalid Configuration 

- Load invalid startup configuration with errors
- Power on device 
- Verify device detects errors and boots to safe mode
- Verify limited default configuration is loaded in safe mode
- Verify device logs configuration errors 

## Test Bootup with Missing Configuration

- Remove startup configuration file
- Power on device
- Verify device boots to default factory configuration
- Verify default interfaces and routing protocols come up
- Verify device logs missing configuration on boot

## Test Bootup Hardware Failure

- Simulate fan failure 
- Power on device
- Verify device detects fan failure
- Verify device boots to safe mode on degraded hardware
- Verify fault LEDs activate
- Verify device logs hardware failure

## Test New Software Upgrade

- Load new router software image
- Power on device 
- Verify device detects new software version
- Verify device upgrades operating system successfully
- Verify device preserves existing configuration
- Verify router functions on new software version
```

This provides some example test cases that could be automated to validate the bootup process and different scenarios like configuration issues, hardware failures, and software upgrades. The tests verify the device boots to the expected state and logs any issues properly. Here are some example unit test cases for the bootup process on an MX480 router in markdown format:

## Test Case 1 - Basic Bootup

### Setup
- Power off the MX480
- Connect console cable to MX480
- Connect power cable to MX480

### Execution 
- Power on the MX480 and watch console output

### Verification
- Verify console displays normal boot messages including:
  - BIOS Initialization
  - Loading Kernel
  - Starting Init Process
  - Junos OS Booting Screen 
  - Completing Boot Sequence
- Verify MX480 boots to operational state

### Teardown
- Power off MX480

## Test Case 2 - Bootup with Configured Rescue Configuration

### Setup
- Power off MX480
- Connect console cable 
- Pre-configure rescue config on MX480

### Execution
- Power on MX480 and interrupt boot sequence 
- Select option to load rescue configuration

### Verification
- Verify console output shows loading rescue config
- Verify MX480 boots with rescue config instead of normal config

### Teardown 
- Power off MX480
- Remove rescue config 

## Test Case 3 - Boot Failure Recovery

### Setup
- Power off MX480
- Connect console cable
- Corrupt boot image on MX480 flash 

### Execution
- Power on MX480 and watch console

### Verification
- Verify boot failure on main image
- Verify MX480 falls back to rescue image
- Verify MX480 boots fully with rescue image

### Teardown
- Power off MX480
- Restore good boot image Here is a Python unit test for the bootup process of the MX480 router in Markdown format:

```python
import unittest
from junos_mx480 import MX480 

class TestMX480Bootup(unittest.TestCase):

    def setUp(self):
        self.mx480 = MX480()

    def test_power_on(self):
        # Power on the device
        self.mx480.power_on()
        
        # Verify power LED is lit
        self.assertTrue(self.mx480.power_led_on)

        # Verify fans spin up 
        self.assertTrue(self.mx480.fans_spinning)

    def test_boot_sequence(self):
        # Perform boot sequence
        self.mx480.boot()

        # Verify ROM monitor loads
        self.assertTrue(self.mx480.rommon_loaded())

        # Verify boot loader loads 
        self.assertTrue(self.mx480.bootloader_loaded())

        # Verify Junos kernel loads
        self.assertTrue(self.mx480.junos_kernel_loaded())

        # Verify Junos daemons start
        self.assertTrue(self.mx480.daemons_running())

    def test_routing_engine_redundancy(self):
        # Boot device with only RE0 powered on
        self.mx480.power_on_re0_only()
        
        # Verify RE0 becomes master 
        self.assertEqual(self.mx480.re0_state, 'master')

        # Power on RE1
        self.mx480.power_on_re1()

        # Verify RE0 remains master
        self.assertEqual(self.mx480.re0_state, 'master')
        self.assertEqual(self.mx480.re1_state, 'backup')

        # Simulate failure of RE0
        self.mx480.fail_re0()

        # Verify RE1 takes over as master
        self.assertEqual(self.mx480.re0_state, 'failed')
        self.assertEqual(self.mx480.re1_state, 'master')

    def tearDown(self):
        self.mx480.power_off()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

This covers power on testing, the main boot sequence, and routing engine redundancy. Additional tests could be added for more subsystems like interface initialization, protocol daemons, etc. Here is a sample unit test for the bootup process on an MX480 router:

## Unit Test - MX480 Router Bootup

### Test Setup

- Router model: MX480
- Junos version: 19.2R1.9

### Test Steps

1. Power on the MX480 and wait for it to fully boot. 

2. Verify the chassis LEDs are lit up and fans are spinning.

3. Connect to the console port and verify the boot messages:

    ```
    BIOS in ROM - console
   JUNOS Copyright
   ... 
    ```

4. Check that all expected Routing Engines have booted up successfully:

    ```
    rpki-validator fpc0
    rpd fpc0
    chassisd fpc0 
    dcd fpc0
    ```

5. Verify FPCs and PICs have powered up:

    ```
    FPC 0 powered up
    PIC 0 powered up 
    PIC 1 powered up
    ```

6. Check interface status shows all expected ports are up:

    ```
    ge-0/0/0 up up 
    ge-0/0/1 up up
    ...
    ```

7. Verify protocols have started:

    ```
    OSPF running 
    BGP running
    ```

8. Confirm routing table and firewall filters have been loaded 

9. Check configuration mode and confirm commits have been loaded:

    ```
    {master}
    commit check 
 
    Configuration checked successfully.
    ```

10. Verify clock is synced to NTP server

11. Run `show system storage` and check available storage space

12. Check SNMP traps and syslogs are being sent to monitoring servers

### Test Result

- Bootup completed successfully with expected configuration loaded 
- All hardware components powered on
- Protocols and daemons running 
- Management access verified
