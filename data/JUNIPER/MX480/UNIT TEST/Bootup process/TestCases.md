 Here are some unit test cases for bootup process for the Juniper Networks MX480 router in markdown format:

## Test Cases for MX480 Router Bootup

### TC1 - Power on self test
**Description:** Verify power on self test (POST) completes successfully when powering on the router.

**Steps:**  
1. Power off the router if it is already powered on
2. Connect console cable to router 
3. Power on the router
4. Verify console displays boot messages and POST completes successfully without any errors or failure messages

**Expected Result:** 
- Console displays normal boot messages
- POST completes successfully without any errors/failures

### TC2 - Load operating system 
**Description:** Verify router loads JUNOS operating system successfully.

**Steps:**
1. Power on the router (if not already powered on) 
2. Connect console cable to router
3. Verify JUNOS OS boots up properly to operational mode without any kernel crashes or failure messages

**Expected Result:**
- JUNOS OS loads properly without any errors
- Router displays normal operational mode prompt without any kernel failures

### TC3 - Verify interfaces initialization
**Description:** Confirm all expected interfaces come up properly after bootup.

**Steps:**
1. Check interface status after router is fully booted 
2. Execute `show interfaces terse` command
3. Verify status for all expected interfaces is "up"

**Expected Result:**
- All configured interfaces initialized properly with status "up"

Let me know if you need any other specifics on the bootup test cases! I can provide more details on verifying additional subsystems as well. Here is an example unit test plan for the bootup process on an MX480 router, with test cases formatted in Markdown:

# Unit Test Plan - MX480 Router Bootup

## Test Case 1 - Power On Self Test

### Setup
- Power off the MX480
- Connect console cable to CONSOLE port 

### Execution
- Power on the MX480

### Verification 
- Verify boot messages are displayed on the console
- Verify "Power On Self Test Passed" message is displayed

### Teardown
- Power off the MX480

## Test Case 2 - Load Operating System 

### Setup
- Power on the MX480

### Execution
- Monitor boot process on the console

### Verification
- Verify Junos OS kernel load messages are displayed
- Verify "Junos OS bootup complete" message is displayed

### Teardown 
- Leave MX480 powered on for next test

## Test Case 3 - Verify Interfaces Up

### Setup 
- MX480 powered on with Junos OS loaded

### Execution
- No action, let system finish boot process

### Verification
- Enter `show interfaces terse` command 
- Verify all expected interfaces show status up

### Teardown
- Power off MX480

Let me know if you need any other details or have additional test cases to cover! I can provide more examples. Unfortunately I do not have the details or code to provide a Python unit test for the bootup process of the MX480 router. As an AI assistant without access to Juniper's codebase or documentation, I cannot generate an accurate unit test. However, I can provide a template for what such a Python unit test may look like in markdown format:

```python
import unittest
from router import MX480

class TestMX480Bootup(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_bootup(self):
        # Arrange 
        router = MX480()
        
        # Act 
        router.boot()
        
        # Assert 
        self.assertEqual(router.state, "active") 
        self.assertTrue(router.all_components_activated())
        
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

This simply imports the necessary frameworks, sets up a sample test case, and stubs out some assertions for testing state changes and component activation during boot. The actual unit test would require more knowledge of the internal logic and component initialization during the MX480 bootup sequence to properly validate the functionality. Let me know if you would like me to explain further or provide any other details I may be capable of generating without access to Juniper documentation or code. Here is an example unit test for the bootup process on an MX480 router to verify configuration in markdown format:

# MX480 Router Bootup Configuration Test

## Test Objective
Perform a detailed test of the MX480 router bootup process to verify proper loading of configurations.

## Test Prerequisites
- MX480 router
- Console/SSH access to router  
- Lab network with connectivity to MX480

## Test Steps
1. Connect console/SSH to the MX480 router
2. Power on the router and monitor boot messages
   ```
   Juniper MX480 booting...
   BIOS version...
   Checking hardware....
   Loading configs...
   ```
3. Validate configurations have loaded properly 
   - Check active configuration
     ```
     show configuration | display set
     ```
   - Verify routing protocols
     ```
     show bgp summary 
     show ospf neighbor
     show isis adjacency 
     ```
   - Check services are enabled
     ```
     show services
     ```

4. Validate data plane/forwarding  plane
   - Ping test to check connectivity 
   - Confirm route tables have updated
     ```
     show route receive-protocol bgp     
     show route receive-protocol ospf
     ```

## Expected Results
- Router should boot properly without any error messages
- Configurations from intended configuration files are loaded
- Routing protocols establish connectivity 
- Services successfully enabled
- Data and control planes are operational

## Test Result
- PASS: Router booted up properly and configurations were loaded as expected
- FAIL: Router failed during bootup (List of any failures)
