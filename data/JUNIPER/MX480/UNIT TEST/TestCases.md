```shell
show interfaces ge-0/0/0
```

The output should display the configured IP address.

#### Teardown:
Exit configuration mode and log out from the device.

```shell
exit
exit
exit
logout
```

### Test Case 2: ACL Configuration

#### Setup:
- Connect to the MX480 device using SSH.
- Enter configuration mode.

```shell
ssh admin@MX480
configure
```

#### Execution:
Configure an access control list to deny traffic from source IP 10.0.0.0/24 to destination IP 192.168.1.0/24.

```shell
set firewall family inet filter ACL term 1 from source-address 10.0.0.0/24
set firewall family inet filter ACL term 1 from destination-address 192.168.1.0/24
set firewall family inet filter ACL term 1 then reject
set firewall family inet filter ACL term 2 then accept
commit
```

#### Verification:
Check the configured access control list details.

```shell
show configuration firewall
```

The output should show the configured ACL rules.

#### Teardown:
Exit configuration mode and log out from the device.

```shell
exit
exit
exit
logout
```

---

### Test Case 3: BGP Peering Configuration

#### Setup:
- Connect to the MX480 device using SSH.
- Enter configuration mode.

```shell
ssh admin@MX480
configure
```

#### Execution:
Configure BGP peering with neighbor 192.168.1.2

```shell
set protocols bgp group internal type internal
set protocols bgp group internal local-address 192.168.1.1
set protocols bgp group internal neighbor 192.168.1.2
commit
```

#### Verification:
Check the configured BGP peering details.

```shell
show configuration protocols bgp
```

The output should display the configured BGP peerings.

#### Teardown:
Exit configuration mode and log out from the device.

```shell
exit
exit
exit
logout
```

# MX480 Python Unit Test

## Introduction
The MX480 unit from Juniper Networks is a high-performance, highly efficient and scalable routing platform. In this unit test, we will be using Python to test the functionality of the MX480.

## Test 1: Interface Configuration
### Description
We will be testing the configuration of the interfaces on the MX480.

### Test Procedure
1. Create a test interface configuration.
2. Apply the configuration to the MX480.
3. Verify that the interface configuration is applied successfully.

### Code Snippet
```python
def test_interface_configuration():
    test_config = {
        "interface": "ge-0/0/0",
        "ipv4_address": "192.168.1.1/24",
        "description": "Test Interface"
    }
    
    mx480.apply_interface_config(test_config)
    
    assert mx480.verify_interface_config(test_config)
```

## Test 2: Routing Table
### Description
We will be testing the routing table functionality of the MX480.

### Test Procedure
1. Add a test route to the routing table.
2. Verify that the route is added successfully.
3. Remove the test route from the routing table.
4. Verify that the route is removed successfully.

### Code Snippet
```python
def test_routing_table():
    test_route = {
        "destination": "192.168.2.0/24",
        "next_hop": "192.168.1.2",
        "interface": "ge-0/0/1"
    }
    
    mx480.add_route(test_route)
    
    assert mx480.verify_route_added(test_route)
    
    mx480.remove_route(test_route)
    
    assert mx480.verify_route_removed(test_route)
```

# MX480 Router Configuration Unit Test

## Objective
The objective of this unit test is to verify the configuration of the MX480 router to ensure that all settings are correctly applied.

## Configuration Details
The configuration details of the MX480 router are as follows:
- Hostname: MX480
- Interfaces: ge-0/0/0, ge-0/0/1
- Routing Protocols: OSPF, BGP
- Security Policies: Permit all traffic
- SNMP Configuration: Version 3, Encryption enabled

## Test Steps
1. Verify the hostname configuration.
2. Check the configuration of interfaces ge-0/0/0 and ge-0/0/1.
3. Verify the settings for OSPF and BGP routing protocols.
4. Confirm the security policies to permit all traffic.
5. Check the SNMP configuration and ensure encryption is enabled.

## Test Results
### Hostname Configuration

<interface configuration output>
```

### Routing Protocol Configuration
```plaintext
user@MX480> show configuration protocols ospf
<OSPF configuration output>

user@MX480> show configuration protocols bgp
<BGP configuration output>
