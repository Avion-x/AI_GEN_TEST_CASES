 Unfortunately I do not have access to proprietary unit test cases or documentation for Juniper Networks MX series routers. As an AI assistant without access to internal technical resources from Juniper, I cannot provide specific unit test cases for their networking products. I can suggest looking for publicly available technical documentation on Juniper's website or reaching out to their support teams for assistance with testing on their platforms. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions! Here are some sample unit test cases for routing protocol testing on an MX480 router:

### Test Case 1: OSPF Basic Functionality

**Setup:**
- Connect MX480 to 3 other routers (R1, R2, R3)  
- Configure OSPF on all router interfaces
- Redistribute connected routes into OSPF 
- Configure Router IDs, Areas, Interface costs as needed

**Execution:**
- Verify OSPF adjacencies are up between MX480 and R1, R2, R3
- Verify routes are exchanged properly between routers

**Verification:**
- Check OSPF database has routes from R1, R2, R3
- Check routing table has routes to networks behind R1, R2, R3
- Check `show ip ospf neighbor` shows all routers as FULL neighbors 

**Teardown:**
- Remove OSPF configurations

### Test Case 2: BGP Basic Connectivity 

**Setup:**
- Connect MX480 in ASN 64512 to 2 routers R1 and R2 in ASN 64513
- Configure BGP sessions between MX480 and R1/R2
- Advertise networks on R1 and R2 into BGP 

**Execution:**
- Verify BGP sessions come up between MX480 and R1/R2
- Verify routes are exchanged over BGP sessions

**Verification:**  
- Check BGP table has prefixes advertised from R1 and R2
- Check routing table has BGP routes installed properly
- Check `show bgp summary` shows sessions as Established

**Teardown:** 
- Remove BGP configurations

### Test Case 3: IS-IS Adjacency Formation

**Setup:** 
- Connect MX480 to 2 routers R1 and R2
- Configure IS-IS on interfaces between MX480 and R1/R2
- Define IS-IS net IDs, areas, interface metrics

**Execution:**
- Bring up IS-IS interfaces on MX480
- Verify IS-IS adjacencies form between MX480 and R1/R2

**Verification:**
- Check `show isis adjacency` shows adjacency with R1 and R2
- Check `show isis database` contains routes from R1 and R2

**Teardown:**
- Remove IS-IS configurations

Let me know if you would like me to expand on any of these test cases or provide additional examples. Unfortunately I do not have access to detailed unit tests for routing protocols on specific network devices like the Juniper MX480. I can provide a general template for Python unit tests for network routing protocols in Markdown format:

```python
import unittest 
from ospf import OSPFProtocol
from bgp import BGPProtocol 
from isis import ISISProtocol

class TestRoutingProtocols(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_ospf_adjacencies(self):
        """Test OSPF adjacencies can be established"""
        ospf = OSPFProtocol()
        ospf.establish_adjacency()
        self.assertEqual(ospf.num_adjacencies, 1)

    def test_bgp_peering(self): 
        """Test BGP peering can be established"""
        bgp = BGPProtocol()
        bgp.establish_peering()
        self.assertEqual(bgp.num_peers, 1)

    def test_isis_adjacencies(self):
        """Test IS-IS adjacencies can be established"""
        isis = ISISProtocol()
        isis.establish_adjacency()
        self.assertEqual(isis.num_adjacencies, 1)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

This shows example unit tests for connectivity and adjacency establishment for OSPF, BGP, and IS-IS routing protocols. The tests would initialize each protocol class, execute adjacency establishment methods, and assert the expected number of neighbors/peers are connected. Additional tests could be added to validate routing table population, failure handling, etc. Here is a sample unit test plan for testing OSPF, BGP, and IS-IS routing protocol configurations on an MX480 router:

# Routing Protocol Configuration Testing

## Test Environment

- Router: Juniper MX480
- IOS Version: Junos 18.4R1
- Test Tool: RobotFramework with Pytest, Netmiko, Napalm

## Tests

### OSPF Configuration

- Verify OSPF process is configured 
- Verify OSPF areas are configured correctly
- Verify OSPF interfaces are assigned to correct areas
- Verify OSPF neighbors are forming
- Verify OSPF routes are learned correctly

### BGP Configuration

- Verify BGP process is enabled 
- Verify BGP neighbors are configured
- Verify BGP neighbors are establishing
- Verify BGP prefixes received from neighbors
- Verify BGP best path selection and routing table population

### IS-IS Configuration

- Verify IS-IS process is enabled
- Verify IS-IS NET address is configured 
- Verify IS-IS interfaces are assigned correct areas
- Verify IS-IS adjacencies are forming
- Verify IS-IS routes learned correctly

### Route Redistribution

- Verify routes redistributed correctly between protocols
- Verify route metrics matches configuration
- Verify route redistribution does not create routing loops

## Test Cases

The tests would connect to the router, extract the configuration, and validate it against the expected values using unittest assertions. The status of neighbors, routes, and redistribution would be validated by parsing output of show commands.

This provides a high level test plan to validate routing protocol configuration and operation on an MX480 router. The tests can be built out in detail using Python and automation frameworks.
