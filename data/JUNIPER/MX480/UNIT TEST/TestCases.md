# Unit Test Cases for Network MSeries Router MX480

## Test Case 1: Interface Configuration
### Description:
This test case ensures that the router's interfaces are configured correctly and are able to transmit and receive data.

### Test Steps:
1. Verify that the interface configuration file is loaded successfully.
2. Send test data through each interface and verify the receipt of data on the other end.

### Expected Output:
```
Interface configuration file loaded successfully.
Data transmitted and received on all interfaces without loss.
```

## Test Case 2: Routing Table
### Description:
This test case verifies the proper functioning of the router's routing table and its ability to route traffic to the correct destination.

### Test Steps:
1. Verify the presence of the correct routing table entries.
2. Send test packets to various destinations and verify that they are routed correctly.

### Expected Output:
```
Routing table entries are present and accurate.
Test packets are routed to the correct destinations without any errors.
```

## Test Case 3: Quality of Service (QoS)
### Description:
This test case ensures that the router's quality of service settings are functioning as expected and are able to prioritize traffic accordingly.

### Test Steps:
1. Send test data with different QoS markings and verify that they are prioritized correctly.
2. Verify that the router is able to manage bandwidth effectively under different traffic conditions.

### Expected Output:
```
Traffic with higher QoS markings is prioritized over lower QoS traffic.
Bandwidth is managed effectively, and QoS settings function as expected.
```

## Test Case 4: Security
### Description:
This test case verifies the security features of the router, including access control lists and firewall functionality.

### Test Steps:
1. Attempt to access restricted resources and verify that access is denied.
2. Test the firewall by sending prohibited traffic and ensure that it is blocked.

### Expected Output:
```
Restricted resources are inaccessible as per the access control lists.
Prohibited traffic is successfully blocked by the firewall.

# MX480 Python Unit Test

## Introduction
The MX480 is a high-performance, high-density Ethernet platform made by Juniper Networks. It is a versatile router suitable for data center, enterprise, and service provider applications. This document demonstrates a detailed Python unit test of the MX480.

## Test Setup
To begin the unit test for the MX480, we will first import the necessary modules and set up the environment.

```python
import unittest
from mx480 import MX480
```

## Test Cases

### Unit Test 1: Verify Power Supply Status
```python
class TestMX480(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.mx480 = MX480()
    
    def test_power_supply_status(self):
        status = self.mx480.get_power_supply_status()
        self.assertEqual(status, "OK", "Power supply status is not as expected")
```

In this test case, we are verifying the power supply status of the MX480 router. We expect the status to be "OK".

### Unit Test 2: Verify Interface Configuration
```python
class TestMX480(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.mx480 = MX480()
    
    def test_interface_config(self):
        config = self.mx480.get_interface_config('ge-0/0/0')
        expected_config = {
            'ipv4_address': '192.168.1.1',
            'subnet_mask': '255.255.255.0'
        }
        self.assertDictEqual(config, expected_config, "Interface configuration does not match expected values")
```

In this test case, we are verifying the configuration of a specific interface "ge-0/0/0" on the MX480 router.

### Unit Test 3: Verify BGP Peering Status
```python
class TestMX480(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.mx480 = MX480()
    
    def test_bgp_peering_status(self):
        status = self.mx480.get_bgp_peering_status()
        self.assertTrue(status, "BGP peering is not established")
```

In this test case, we are verifying the BGP peering status on the MX480 router.

## Conclusion
This detailed Python unit test covers important aspects of the MX480 including power supply status, interface configuration, and BGP peering status. The results of the test will help ensure the reliability and performance of the router in various networking scenarios.

inet.0: 8 destinations, 8 routes (8 active, 0 holddown, 0 hidden)

+ = Active Route, - = Last Active, * = Both

192.168.1.0/24      *[Direct/0] 00:01:20
                    > via ge-0/0/0.0
10.0.0.0/24        *[Direct/0] 00:01:20
                    > via ge-0/0/1.0
```

```

## Conclusion
The unit test has been completed, and based on the inspection of the router's configuration, it has been verified that the MX480 router is correctly set up as per the specified requirements.
