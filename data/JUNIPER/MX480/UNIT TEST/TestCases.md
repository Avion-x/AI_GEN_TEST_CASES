Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements for the unit test cases. Here are some sample unit tests for the Juniper MX480 router in markdown format:

## Unit Tests for Juniper MX480 Router

### Test Setup 

- Acquire MX480 router and connect to power and console port
- Load latest Junos OS software image
- Connect test traffic generator to appropriate interfaces

### Test Case 1 - Verify OSPF Configuration

**Setup**

- Configure 2 interfaces on MX480 in different subnets
- Configure OSPF on the interfaces  

**Execution**

- Verify OSPF neighbor adjacency is established
- Send test traffic between interfaces with OSPF enabled

**Verification** 

- Check routing table has routes learned via OSPF 
- Verify test traffic passes between OSPF interfaces

**Teardown**

- Remove OSPF configuration from interfaces

### Test Case 2 - Verify BGP Configuration 

**Setup**

- Connect MX480 to external BGP peer
- Configure BGP session between MX480 and peer

**Execution** 

- Verify BGP session is established
- Advertise test prefixes from BGP peer

**Verification**

- Check routing table has prefixes learned from BGP peer
- Send test traffic to prefixes advertised by BGP peer

**Teardown** 

- Remove BGP configuration

### Test Case 3 - Verify OSPF and BGP Interaction

**Setup** 

- Configure OSPF and BGP as per previous test cases

**Execution**

- Verify OSPF and BGP sessions are established 
- Advertise same prefixes on BGP and OSPF 

**Verification**

- Check routing table has prefixes via both protocols  
- Send test traffic and verify forwarding occurs correctly

**Teardown**

- Remove OSPF and BGP configurations Here is a Python unit test skeleton for testing the Juniper MX480 router:

```python
import unittest

class TestMX480(unittest.TestCase):

    def setUp(self):
        # Setup code goes here
        pass

    def tearDown(self):
        # Teardown code goes here
        pass

    def test_power_on(self):
        # Test powering on the device
        pass

    def test_login(self):
        # Test logging into the device
        pass

    def test_get_version(self):
        # Test getting version information
        pass

    def test_get_interfaces(self):
        # Test getting interface information
        pass

    def test_set_interface_ip(self):
        # Test configuring an IP address on an interface
        pass

    def test_bgp_neighbors(self):
        # Test getting BGP neighbor information
        pass

    def test_ospf_neighbors(self):
        # Test getting OSPF neighbor information
        pass

    def test_commit_config(self):
        # Test committing a configuration
        pass

    def test_rollback_config(self):
        # Test rolling back the configuration
        pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

This provides a starting point for writing detailed unit tests for the MX480. Each test method would connect to the device, execute the relevant commands, and assert the expected output or behavior. More tests can be added for other features and protocols supported on the MX480. Here is a sample unit test in markdown format for running a detailed test on the MX480 router to verify configuration:

## Unit Test - MX480 Router Configuration Verification

### Test Setup

- Router Under Test: MX480
- IOS Version: 18.4R3-S2.5
- Test Tool: Ansible playbook

### Test Cases

#### Verify Base Configuration

- Check hostname is configured correctly as `mx480-1`
- Check admin password is set correctly 
- Validate NTP servers are configured:
  - `ntp server 192.168.1.1`
  - `ntp server 192.168.1.2`
- Verify syslog servers are configured:
  - `logging 192.168.100.1`
  - `logging 192.168.100.2`

Expected results:
- Hostname, passwords, NTP servers and syslog servers should be configured as specified

#### Verify Interfaces Configuration

- Check interfaces ge-0/0/0 and ge-0/0/1 are configured in a single L3 VLAN:
  - `vlan members vlan100 ge-0/0/0`
  - `vlan members vlan100 ge-0/0/1`
- Validate IP addresses on interfaces:
  - `ge-0/0/0 unit 0 family inet address 192.168.100.1/24` 
  - `ge-0/0/1 unit 0 family inet address 192.168.100.2/24`
- Verify OSPF is enabled on vlan100 interface with correct area and parameters

Expected results: 
- Interfaces ge-0/0/0 and ge-0/0/1 should be members of vlan100
- IP addresses should match planned addresses 
- OSPF should be configured properly on vlan100 interface

#### Verify Routing Configuration

- Validate default route is set correctly:
  - `set routing-options static route 0.0.0.0/0 next-hop 192.168.100.254`
- Check OSPF neighbors are formed
- Verify route learned via OSPF for 192.168.200.0/24 network 

Expected results:
- Default route should be installed correctly
- OSPF neighbors should be in full state  
- Routes learned via OSPF should be present in routing table

### Test Results

- All test cases passed successfully!
- Router configuration validated as per plan.

This covers some essential test cases to verify the base configuration, interfaces, and routing on the MX480 router. Additional test cases can be added as per specific requirements. The test results section summarizes the overall test pass/fail status.
