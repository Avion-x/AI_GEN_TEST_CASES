 Unfortunately I do not have access to proprietary unit test cases for Juniper Networks routers. However, here is a general outline for unit testing routing protocol implementations on a router in markdown format:

# Unit Testing Routing Protocols on Juniper MX480

## Test Cases

### OSPF

- Neighbor adjacency establishment
  - Verify new OSPF neighbors are discovered properly
  - Validate neighbor state progresses to Full
- LSA origination and flooding
  - Validate router generates proper LSAs for its links and networks
  - Confirm LSAs received from neighbors are flooded to other neighbors
- Routing table calculation
  - Verify routes are installed in routing table correctly based on received LSAs
  - Check routing table is updated properly when LSAs change

### BGP 

- Neighbor peering
  - Confirm new BGP peers connect and establish session
  - Validate keepalive messages exchanged properly 
- Route advertisement
  - Verify routes advertised to and received from peers are as expected
  - Confirm attributes like AS_PATH and communities are handled properly
- Route selection
  - Check highest priority route is selected and installed in routing table
  - Validate selection process follows BGP decision process rules

### IS-IS

- Adjacency formation
  - Verify IS-IS adjacencies established properly with neighbors
  - Check adjacency state progresses properly through states
- LSP origination and flooding
  - Confirm router generates LSPs for its links and networks
  - Validate received LSPs are reflooded to other neighbors
- Routing table calculation
  - Check routes installed in table properly based on LSPs
  - Verify routing table updated appropriately on LSP changes

## Test Environment

- Virtualized MX480 router image (e.g. vMX)
-Adjacent routers emulated for IGP and EBGP peering
-Routing protocol configurations to enable OSPF, BGP, IS-IS
-Traffic generators to send packets for forwarding tests

## Automation Framework

- PyTest for writing and executing test cases
- Netmiko/NAPALM for programmatic router configuration 
- Scapy for crafting routing protocol packets
- Jenkins for CI/CD and automated testing Here are some sample unit test cases for routing protocol testing on an MX480 router:

## Test Cases for OSPF Routing Protocol 

### Test basic OSPF neighbor adjacency

**Setup:**
- Configure OSPF on two directly connected interfaces on the MX480
- Assign interfaces to same OSPF area

**Execution:**
- Bring up OSPF interfaces

**Verification:**
- Verify OSPF neighbors are coming up using `show ospf neighbor`
- Verify OSPF database is exchanged using `show ospf database` 

**Teardown:**
- Shutdown OSPF interfaces

### Test OSPF route installation

**Setup:**
- Configure OSPF on three interfaces on MX480
- Assign interfaces to different OSPF areas
- Configure loopbacks with addresses in each area

**Execution:** 
- Bring up OSPF on interfaces

**Verification:**
- Verify routes from other areas are installed in routing table using `show route ospf`

**Teardown:** 
- Shutdown OSPF interfaces

### Test OSPF MD5 authentication

**Setup:**
- Configure OSPF neighbors with MD5 authentication
- Configure matching MD5 keys 

**Execution:**
- Start OSPF neighbors

**Verification:** 
- Verify OSPF adjacency forms using `show ospf neighbor`

**Teardown:**
- Remove MD5 authentication

## Test Cases for BGP Routing Protocol

### Test basic BGP peering

**Setup:** 
- Configure eBGP peering between two MX480 routers

**Execution:**
- Bring up BGP peers

**Verification:**
- Verify BGP peering is established using `show bgp summary` 

**Teardown:** 
- Shutdown BGP peers

### Test BGP route exchange

**Setup:**
- Configure eBGP peering between MX480 routers
- Advertise networks on routers

**Execution:**
- Start BGP peers

**Verification:**  
- Verify routes are exchanged using `show bgp`
- Verify routes installed in routing table using `show route`

**Teardown:**
- Remove advertised networks
- Shutdown peers

### Test BGP MD5 authentication

**Setup:**
- Configure BGP peers with MD5 authentication 
- Configure matching MD5 keys

**Execution:**  
- Start BGP peers

**Verification:**
- Verify BGP peers establish with MD5 auth using `show bgp neighbor`

**Teardown:**
- Remove MD5 authentication

The test cases would follow a similar format for IS-IS and other routing protocols, covering basic functionality, route exchange, and security. Unfortunately I do not have access to detailed information about the internal workings or test cases for Juniper's MX480 router. However, here is an example of what Python unit tests for routing protocol implementations may look like in Markdown format:

# Unit Tests for Routing Protocols

## TestOSPF

```python
import unittest
from ospf import OSPFRouter

class TestOSPF(unittest.TestCase):

    def setUp(self):
        self.router = OSPFRouter()

    def test_add_ospf_neighbor(self):
        self.router.add_neighbor("192.168.1.1")
        self.assertIn("192.168.1.1", self.router.ospf_neighbors)

    def test_receive_ospf_update(self):
        update = OSPFUpdate(...)
        self.router.receive_update(update)
        self.assertIn(update, self.router.ospf_database)

    # Additional tests...

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

## TestBGP 

```python
import unittest 
from bgp import BGPRouter

class TestBGP(unittest.TestCase):

    def setUp(self):
        self.router = BGPRouter()

    def test_add_bgp_peer(self):
        self.router.add_peer("10.10.10.1")
        self.assertIn("10.10.10.1", self.router.bgp_peers)

    def test_receive_bgp_update(self):
        update = BGPUpdate(...)
        self.router.receive_update(update)
        self.assertIn(update, self.router.bgp_table)

    # Additional tests...
        
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

## TestISIS

```python
import unittest
from isis import ISISRouter

class TestISIS(unittest.TestCase):

    def setUp(self):
        self.router = ISISRouter()

    def test_add_isis_neighbor(self):
        self.router.add_neighbor("ABCD.1234.AB01")
        self.assertIn("ABCD.1234.AB01", self.router.isis_neighbors)

    def test_receive_isis_update(self):
        update = ISISUpdate(...)
        self.router.receive_update(update)
        self.assertIn(update, self.router.isis_database)

    # Additional tests...

if __name__ == '__main__': 
    unittest.main()
```

This provides some example tests cases and assertions for testing core routing protocol functionality. Additional tests would be needed for more complex scenarios and edge cases. Here is a sample unit test for routing protocols on the Juniper MX480 router in markdown format:

- Verify routing table has routes installed from all protocols
- Verify routing table has correct routes based on protocol metrics
- Verify no black holes or routing loops

#### Failover Testing

- Simulate link failures and verify protocols converge correctly 
- Simulate neighbor loss and verify protocols reconverge
- Verify no traffic loss during convergence

### Test Results

- All test cases passed successfully
- No issues found with routing protocol configuration 
- Traffic continued to flow during network failures and reconvergence

The MX480 passed the routing protocol validation testing and is configured properly for OSPF, BGP and IS-IS operation.
