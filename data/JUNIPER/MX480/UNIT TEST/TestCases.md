 Here is sample unit test cases for routing protocol implementations on Juniper MX480 router in markdown format:

- Verify IS-IS summary prefixes and suppression of intra-area routes

The above covers some of the key test scenarios for routing protocol implementations. Detailed test cases would be needed for comprehensive testing. Here is a sample unit test case for testing OSPF routing protocol on an MX480 router:

### Test OSPF Routing Protocol on MX480

#### Test Setup

- Connect MX480 to test network with 2 routers (R1 and R2)    
- Configure OSPF on MX480 and R1, R2
- Advertise networks on R1, R2 and ensure routes are learnt on MX480
- Verify OSPF neighbors are established between MX480, R1 and R2

#### Test Execution 

1. Configure OSPF on MX480
   ```
   set protocols ospf area 0.0.0.0 interface ge-0/0/0
   set protocols ospf area 0.0.0.0 interface lo0  
   ```

2. Configure OSPF on R1 and R2, advertise networks

3. On MX480 verify OSPF neighbors
   ```
   show ospf neighbor 
      Neighbor ID     Pri State           Dead Time   Address         Interface
      192.168.0.2       1 Full/DROther       32.436s 192.168.0.2     ge-0/0/0 
      192.168.0.3       1 Full/DROther       36.993s 192.168.0.3     ge-0/0/1
   ```

4. On MX480 verify routes learnt via OSPF
   ```
   show route protocol ospf  
      192.168.1.0/24    [OSPF/10] 01:23:45, metric 2        
      192.168.2.0/24    [OSPF/10] 01:23:49, metric 3
   ```

#### Test Verification

- OSPF neighbors established between MX480, R1 and R2
- Routes advertised on R1 and R2 correctly learnt on MX480 via OSPF

#### Test Teardown  

- Remove OSPF configurations on MX480, R1 and R2
- Disconnect test devices

This covers setup, configuring OSPF, verifying neighbors and routes, and finally teardown of the test. Similar test cases can be created to test BGP, IS-IS etc by configuring the appropriate routing protocol, verifying neighbors and routes. The goal is to validate routing protocol operation on the MX480. Unfortunately I do not have access to detailed technical information about Juniper's MX480 routing protocols or the ability to write Python unit tests. However, here is a brief summary of how one could approach writing unit tests for routing protocol implementations:

# Unit Tests for Routing Protocols on Juniper MX480

## Test Setup
- Obtain MX480 router and configure OSPF, BGP, IS-IS, etc as needed
- Connect router to test network with other routers/hosts to simulate real topology
- Ensure routing protocols are enabled and functioning properly on the test network

## OSPF Tests
- Verify OSPF neighbors are established properly
- Test route advertisement and convergence time on neighbor/link down
- Validate OSPF database synchronization between neighbors 
- Check proper OSPF routes are installed in routing table

## BGP Tests
- Confirm BGP sessions established with peers
- Test route advertisement and withdrawal behaviors
- Validate attributes and policies are handled correctly  
- Ensure proper BGP best paths are selected and installed in routing table

## IS-IS Tests  
- Verify IS-IS adjacencies formed properly
- Test route advertisement and SPF computation time on neighbor/link down
- Check proper IS-IS routes installed in routing table
- Validate IS-IS authentication and other protocol behaviors
      
The tests would connect to the router CLI/APIs to check protocol status, capture packets to analyze protocol operation, inspect routing tables, etc. The tests should be automated using a Python test framework like unittest or pytest. Robust mocks and test virtualization would also be needed to simulate failures and various network events. Here is a sample unit test for testing OSPF, BGP, IS-IS routing protocol configurations on an MX480 router:
