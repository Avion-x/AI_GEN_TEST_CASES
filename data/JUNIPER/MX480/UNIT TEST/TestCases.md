 Here are some example unit tests for routing protocol cases on the Juniper Networks MX480 router:

## OSPF

**Test OSPF neighbor adjacency**

- Configure OSPF on interfaces 
- Verify OSPF neighbors are reachable
- Verify OSPF database is synchronized between neighbors

**Test OSPF route advertisement** 

- Configure OSPF on interfaces
- Introduce routes into OSPF domain
- Verify routes are populated in routing table of neighbors

**Test OSPF authentication**

- Configure OSPF with MD5 authentication 
- Verify OSPF neighbors authenticate successfully 
- Modify authentication password and verify neighbor adjacency fails

## BGP 

**Test BGP basic peering**

- Configure BGP peering between routers
- Verify BGP neighbor adjacency established
- Verify routes exchanged between BGP peers

**Test BGP route advertisement**

- Introduce routes on one BGP router
- Verify routes populated on peered BGP router

**Test BGP authentication** 

- Configure BGP peering with MD5 authentication
- Verify successful authentication 
- Modify BGP password and verify peering goes down

## IS-IS

**Test IS-IS adjacency formation**

- Configure IS-IS on interfaces
- Verify IS-IS adjacencies up between routers

**Test IS-IS route advertisement**

- Introduce routes into IS-IS domain 
- Verify routes populated on IS-IS neighbors

**Test IS-IS authentication** 

- Configure IS-IS authentication
- Verify successful authentication between neighbors
- Modify IS-IS authentication key and verify adjacency failure

Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional cases to cover! Here is an example unit test case for testing OSPF routing protocol on an MX480 router:

## Test OSPF Basic Functionality

### Setup
- Connect MX480 to test lab network with 2 other routers (R1 and R2)    
- Configure OSPF on all routers with router IDs, network statements, etc
- Verify OSPF neighbors are formed between MX480, R1 and R2

### Execution
- Add a new subnet on R1 and verify route is learned by MX480 over OSPF 
- Shut down OSPF on R1 interface to MX480 and verify route is removed from MX480 routing table

### Verification 
- Check MX480 routing table has route learned from R1 over OSPF when subnet added
- Check route removed from MX480 table when OSPF shut down on R1 

### Teardown
- Remove OSPF configurations on all routers
- Disconnect lab connections

## Test OSPF DR/BDR Election

### Setup
- Connect MX480 to test lab network with 2 other routers (R1 and R2)
- Configure OSPF on all routers with same priority 

### Execution
- Verify which router becomes DR and BDR based on router IDs
- Change OSPF priority on R2 to be highest and verify it becomes DR

### Verification
- Check OSPF neighbor output shows correct DR/BDR based on priority/router ID

### Teardown 
- Remove OSPF configurations on all routers
- Disconnect lab connections

## Test OSPF Route Filtering

### Setup
- Connect MX480 to test lab network with 1 other router R1
- Configure OSPF on MX480 and R1

### Execution
- On R1, configure route-map to filter subnet 10.0.0.0/24 from being advertised to MX480
- Verify 10.0.0.0/24 is not learned on MX480 from R1

### Verification
- Check MX480 routing table does not have 10.0.0.0/24 route  

### Teardown
- Remove OSPF and route-map configurations
- Disconnect lab connections Unfortunately I do not have access to router configuration or test data to provide a detailed Python unit test for routing protocols on a specific router model. However, here is an example of what a Python unit test for testing OSPF functionality might look like in Markdown format:

```python
import unittest
from ospf import OSPFProtocol

class OSPFTest(unittest.TestCase):

    def setUp(self):
        self.ospf = OSPFProtocol()
    
    def test_ospf_neighbors(self):
        """Test getting OSPF neighbors"""
        neighbors = self.ospf.get_neighbors()
        self.assertGreater(len(neighbors), 0)

    def test_ospf_routes(self):  
        """Test retrieving OSPF routes"""
        routes = self.ospf.get_routes()
        self.assertGreater(len(routes), 0) 

    def test_ospf_interface_status(self):
        """Test getting OSPF interface status"""
        status = self.ospf.get_interface_status("GigabitEthernet0/0")
        self.assertEqual(status, "Up")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

This shows example test cases for testing core OSPF functionality like getting neighbors, routes and interface status. Similar tests could be written for other protocols like BGP, IS-IS etc. The tests would need to be run on a real router with the protocols configured to validate the functionality. Here is a sample unit test in markdown format for testing OSPF, BGP, and IS-IS routing protocol configurations on an MX480 router:

# Routing Protocol Configuration Unit Tests

## Test Environment

- Router: Juniper MX480
- IOS: Junos 19.2R1.9 

## Tests

### OSPF Configuration

- Verify OSPF is enabled

    ```
    show protocols ospf 
    ```

    - Expected result: OSPF instance is present and enabled

- Verify OSPF neighbors

    ```
    show ospf neighbor
    ```

    - Expected result: Neighbors are present in full state

- Verify OSPF routes in routing table

    ```
    show route ospf
    ```

    - Expected result: OSPF routes are present 

### BGP Configuration

- Verify BGP is enabled

    ```
    show protocols bgp
    ```

    - Expected result: BGP instance is present and enabled

- Verify BGP neighbors

    ```
    show bgp neighbor
    ```

    - Expected result: Neighbors are present in established state

- Verify BGP routes in routing table

    ```
    show route bgp 
    ```

    - Expected result: BGP routes are present

### IS-IS Configuration

- Verify IS-IS is enabled

    ```
    show protocols isis
    ```

    - Expected result: IS-IS instance is present and enabled

- Verify IS-IS adjacencies

    ``` 
    show isis adjacency
    ```

    - Expected result: IS-IS adjacencies are present in state Up

- Verify IS-IS routes in routing table

    ```
    show route isis
    ```

    - Expected result: IS-IS routes are present

This provides a template for validating proper configuration of major routing protocols on a Juniper MX router. The test validates enabling of the protocol, protocol adjacencies, and protocol routes. The tests can be expanded as needed for additional validation.
