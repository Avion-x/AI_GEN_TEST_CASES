# Security Test 1: Input Validation

## Description
This security test aims to evaluate the input validation mechanism in the application. It checks for any vulnerabilities related to user input that could lead to code injection, SQL injection, or other malicious attacks.

## Steps
1. Identify input fields that can accept user input.
2. Use a variety of test cases including special characters, SQL injection strings, and unexpected input.
3. Check if the application handles these inputs appropriately and does not allow any unexpected processing or execution of the input.

## Python Script
```python
# This is a sample Python script for testing input validation

# Import necessary modules

def test_input_validation():
    # Test cases with special characters
    input_field_1 = "'; DROP TABLE users;"
    # Test cases with SQL injection strings
    input_field_2 = "1' OR '1'='1"
    # Test cases with unexpected input
    input_field_3 = "123abc@#"

    # Send input data to the application and observe the behavior
    # Check if the application properly validates and sanitizes the input
    # Log any unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities found
```

# Security Test 2: Authentication and Authorization

## Description
This security test focuses on the authentication and authorization mechanisms in the application. It aims to identify any weaknesses or vulnerabilities related to user access control, session management, and privilege escalation.

## Steps
1. Review the authentication and authorization processes in the application.
2. Simulate various scenarios such as unauthorized access attempts, session hijacking, and privilege escalation.
3. Evaluate the application's response to these scenarios and verify if it properly enforces access control rules.

## Python Script
```python
# This is a sample Python script for testing authentication and authorization

# Import necessary modules

def test_authentication_authorization():
    # Simulate unauthorized access attempts
    # Check if the application denies access as expected
    # Simulate session hijacking
    # Verify if the application detects and prevents session hijacking attempts
    # Simulate privilege escalation
    # Check if the application properly enforces privilege levels and access control
    # Log any vulnerabilities or weaknesses found during the tests
```

Please note that the Python scripts provided are only sample templates and need to be customized based on the specific application being tested.
