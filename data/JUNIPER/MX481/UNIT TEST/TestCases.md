 Here are some sample unit test cases for the Juniper Networks MX Series Router MX480:

## Unit Test Cases for Juniper Networks MX480 Router

### System Initialization and Bootup

- Verify router boots up successfully and enters operational mode 
- Verify bootup messages are logged correctly without any errors
- Verify all hardware components are detected correctly during bootup

### Routing Protocols

- Verify OSPF protocol starts properly and forms neighbor adjacencies  
- Verify BGP protocol starts properly and peers get established
- Verify ISIS protocol starts properly and forms adjacency with other ISIS routers
- Verify protocol states are updated correctly when links or peers go up/down

### Packet Forwarding

- Verify ping works properly between interfaces on the router
- Send test traffic between interfaces and verify forwarding works correctly
- Verify ACLs and firewall filters applied on interfaces properly allow/block traffic

### Management Interfaces 

- Verify SSH access works properly on management interface
- Verify SNMP queries return proper router info when polling OIDs
- Verify NTP time sync works properly and router time is correct  

### High Availability

- Verify SRX redundancy protocol forms properly between primary and backup routers
- Failover primary router and verify backup takes over properly
- Verify session state is synced correctly between primary and backup

### Negative Cases

- Shut down interfaces and verify protocols detect it properly
- Introduce faulty configurations and verify proper errors are reported 
- Trigger failures like NTP failure and verify router handles it gracefully

### Stress Testing

- Send high rates of traffic through router and verify no packets dropped
- Flap interfaces rapidly and verify protocols and forwarding recover properly
- Power cycle router repeatedly and verify it comes back up properly each time
