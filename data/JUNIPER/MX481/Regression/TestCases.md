 Here are some sample regression test cases for the Juniper Networks MX480 router:

## Regression Test Cases for Juniper Networks MX480 Router

### Setup
- Connect MX480 router to test network 
- Install latest Junos OS version
- Configure basic routing, firewall filters, VPNs, etc per device spec

### Basic Functionality
- Verify router boots up successfully 
- Verify routing tables are populated correctly
- Verify control and data plane processes are running 
- Verify interfaces are up and forwarding traffic

### Routing Protocols
- Verify OSPF neighbors form adjacencies properly
- Verify OSPF routes are exchanged and routing table updated
- Verify BGP peers establish sessions and exchange routes 
- Verify RIP interfaces exchange routes
- Verify multicast protocols like PIM, IGMP function properly 

### VPN Functionality
- Verify IPSec VPNs establish tunnels and pass traffic
- Verify MPLS LDP sessions establish properly
- Verify RSVP-TE LSPs come up and forward traffic
- Verify multicast VPN features work across MPLS backbone

### Security, Filters
- Verify firewall filters block/pass traffic as expected
- Verify router responds properly to DoS attacks
- Verify AAA authentication and authorization works

### Interfaces
- Verify all interface types activate properly 
- Verify Ethernet interfaces negotiate speed/duplex correctly
- Verify logical interfaces like VLANs, aggregates work
- Verify QoS queuing and shaping functions properly

### Reliability
- Verify nonstop routing and graceful restart work properly
- Verify redundancy features like redundant power supplies work
- Verify high availability features like NSR prevent outages

### Scaling/Performance
- Verify high route scale specifications met
- Verify high flow traffic levels handled without loss
- Verify multicast route scale specifications met
- Verify SLAs generate proper syslog/SNMP traps
