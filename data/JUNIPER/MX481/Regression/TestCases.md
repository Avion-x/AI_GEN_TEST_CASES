 Here are some potential regression test cases for the Juniper Networks MX Series Router MX480:

## Regression Test Cases for Juniper Networks MX480 Router

### Hardware Tests

- Verify router boots up successfully 
- Verify correct number and type of ports are present (e.g. 10GbE, 40GbE, 100GbE)
- Verify redundant power supplies are operational 
- Verify fans are operational and speeds adjust based on temperature
- Verify correct number of Routing Engines are present
- Verify correct amount of RAM is present
- Verify correct type and size of flash/SSD storage is present

### Basic Configuration Tests

- Verify basic configuration (interfaces, VLANs, etc) via CLI
- Verify basic configuration via web interface (J-Web)
- Verify saving running config to startup config
- Verify rebooting preserves basic configuration

### Routing Tests 

- Verify static routing functions properly
- Verify OSPF neighbor adjacencies form properly
- Verify OSPF routes are properly exchanged and installed in routing table
- Verify BGP neighbor adjacencies form properly 
- Verify BGP routes are properly exchanged and installed in routing table

### Performance Tests

- Verify routing table scale (e.g. 1M routes)
- Verify forwarding performance for various packet sizes 
- Verify control plane stability under load (e.g. flapping OSPF neighbors)
- Verify failover/convergence time for various failure scenarios

### High Availability Tests

- Verify redundant routing engines operate properly
- Verify traffic fails over properly when primary routing engine fails
- Verify interface, software, and hardware failures have minimal traffic disruption 

### Security Tests

- Verify AAA authentication functions properly (e.g. RADIUS)
- Verify access lists properly filter traffic
- Verify control plane protection policies prevent unauthorized access
- Verify logging, monitoring, and SNMP functions work properly
