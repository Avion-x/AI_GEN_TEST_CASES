 Here are some sample regression test cases for the Juniper Networks MX Series MX480 router in markdown format:

### Regression Test Cases for Juniper Networks MX480 Router

**Setup**

- Connect MX480 router to test network 
- Install latest Junos OS software version
- Configure router interfaces, protocols, policies etc per test case needs

**Functionality Testing**

- Verify router boots up properly with no errors
- Verify LED status lights show normal operational status  

**Routing Protocols**

- Configure OSPF on router interfaces
- Verify OSPF neighbors establish adjacency  
- Verify routes learned via OSPF are installed in routing table

**Interfaces**

- Configure physical interfaces with IP addresses 
- Verify interfaces show up/up status
- Verify IP addresses configured correctly 

**Firewall Filters** 

- Create firewall filter to block specific IP traffic
- Verify filter blocks traffic as expected
- Modify firewall filter to allow additional IPs
- Verify traffic now allowed after filter change

**Class of Service**

- Configure traffic shaping policies 
- Generate traffic matching shaping policies
- Verify traffic is rate limited as configured

**VPN**

- Configure IPsec VPN tunnel to remote peer
- Verify tunnel establishes correctly
- Send traffic across VPN tunnel
- Verify traffic passes encrypted over VPN tunnel        

**Routing Engine Switchover**

- Force switchover to standby routing engine  
- Verify traffic continues to flow with no loss
- Verify protocols and sessions reconnect after switchover

**Negative Testing**

- Force unsupported transceiver into router interface
- Verify interface shows down status
- Remove transceiver 
- Verify interface comes back up  

- Shutdown router interface
- Verify interface shows down status
- Bring interface back up
- Verify interface shows up status after bringing up

- Configure router with invalid OSPF parameters
- Verify OSPF neighbors do not establish
- Fix OSPF configuration
- Verify OSPF neighbors establish after fix

The test cases should cover major functional areas of the router and include both positive and negative test scenarios. Additional cases can be added for other features and interfaces supported on the MX480 platform.
