 Here are some sample regression test cases for the Juniper Networks MX Series MX480 router in markdown format:

## Regression Test Cases for Juniper Networks MX480 Router

### Setup

- Connect MX480 router to test network
- Configure MX480 with baseline configuration
- Establish console access to MX480 

### Functionality Testing

#### Routing

- Verify OSPF neighbor adjacency is established
- Verify BGP neighbor adjacency is established 
- Send traffic across OSPF and BGP routes and verify forwarding

#### Firewall Filters 

- Configure firewall filters
- Apply firewall filters to interfaces
- Send permitted and denied traffic to verify filters

#### Class of Service

- Configure CoS policies 
- Apply CoS policies to interfaces
- Send traffic with different DSCP markings and verify CoS queuing  

#### VPN

- Configure IPSec VPN tunnel between MX480 and remote device
- Send traffic across VPN tunnel and verify encryption and tunnel up status

#### Management 

- Verify SNMP traps are sent when configured
- Verify syslog messages are sent when configured
- Verify remote authentication via RADIUS

### Performance Testing

- Send traffic up to max interface bandwidth across all interfaces
- Verify traffic forwarding rate meets datasheet specifications
- Monitor CPU and memory utilization. Verify within supported limits.

### High Availability Testing

- Configure MX480 for chassis redundancy 
- Trigger redundancy switchover
- Verify traffic continues to flow with no loss

### Negative Testing

- Power off one RE and verify redundancy
- Disconnect aggregated ethernet member links
- Shutdown interfaces and verify behavior 

### Cleanup
- Remove MX480 test configuration
- Verify MX480 returns to factory default state
