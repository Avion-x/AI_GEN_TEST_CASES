 Here are some suggested regression test cases for the Juniper Networks MX Series MX480 router:

# Regression Test Cases for Juniper Networks MX480 Router

## Setup
- Obtain MX480 router and connect to power and console port
- Load latest stable JUNOS software version
- Connect interfaces to test network 

## Functionality Testing

### Routing Protocols
- Verify OSPF neighbor adjacencies come up properly
- Verify BGP peering sessions establish correctly 
- Send routes via BGP and verify routes propagated properly
- Modify route maps and policy statements and verify expected behavior

### Services 
- Configure and verify DNS service
- Configure NTP service and verify clock is synchronized 
- Configure SNMP and verify SNMP traps are sent and received properly

### Interfaces
- Configure Ethernet interfaces and verify link status
- Configure logical interfaces such as VLANs and verify connectivity
- Enable link aggregation/LACP and verify bundle link status

### Security
- Configure firewall filters and verify traffic is filtered as expected
- Configure IPsec VPN tunnel and verify successful tunnel establishment
- Test firewall authentication using RADIUS server

### High Availability
- Configure redundant Routing Engines and verify graceful Routing Engine switchover  

### Monitoring
- Verify interface counters and statistics are updating correctly
- Use CLI commands and verify outputs
- Verify system logs and alarms are reporting correctly

### Upgrade/Downgrade
- Upgrade to newer JUNOS version and verify functionality 
- Downgrade to older JUNOS version and verify functionality

## Performance Testing

- Use traffic generator to transmit packets at increasing rates
- Verify forwarding performance and latency at capacity 
- Verify routing and protocol convergence time under load
- Stress test with max routes, firewall filters, VPNs etc.

## Failure Testing

- Power failure and recovery
- Link failure and recovery
- Routing Engine failure and recovery
- Configuration errors and recovery
- Memory exhaustion and recovery

The test cases should cover major functional areas andfailure scenarios to verify the router provides consistent performance and reliability under a varietyof conditions.
