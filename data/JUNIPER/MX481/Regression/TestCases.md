 Here are some sample regression test cases for the Juniper Networks MX Series MX480 router in Markdown format:

## Regression Test Cases for Juniper Networks MX480 Router

### Setup

- Connect MX480 router to test network 
- Load latest Junos OS software image
- Configure router interfaces, routing protocols, etc. per test requirements

### Functionality Testing

#### Routing Protocols

- Verify OSPF neighbors establish adjacencies properly
- Verify router learns routes via OSPF and installs in routing table
- Verify BGP peers establish session and exchange routes
- Modify BGP config and verify changes take effect without disrupting traffic

#### Interfaces

- Verify all interfaces are up/up per config 
- Verify interface statistics increment properly
- Add/remove interfaces and verify proper operation
- Modify interface properties and verify changes take effect

#### Services

- Configure and verify proper operation of NTP, SNMP, logging 
- Modify service configs and verify functionality/config changes

#### Security

- Configure and verify firewall filters operation as expected
- Add/remove firewall filters and verify impact on traffic
- Configure authentication and test access to router interfaces

#### Routing

- Verify router forwards traffic properly based on config
- Add/remove static routes and verify routing table updates
- Modify route preference/metrics and check impact on routing

#### High Availability

- Verify graceful Routing Engine switchover/failover
- Verify interface/service synchronization between Routing Engines 

### Performance Testing

- Connect router to traffic generator
- Send traffic at increasing loads and measure throughput, latency, jitter etc.
- Verify routing/forwarding performance meets specifications

### Failure Testing

- Power off/on router and modules and verify proper restart
- Disconnect/reconnect interfaces and verify graceful handling
- Trigger failures and verify robustness and self-healing capability

The test cases should validate the key functions and features of the router work properly after changes are made to the configuration or software image. Areas like routing protocols, security, interfaces, services should be covered.
