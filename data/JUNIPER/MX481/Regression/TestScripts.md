 Unfortunately I do not have access to python scripts or test cases for the Juniper Networks MX Series routers. As an AI assistant without access to internal Juniper resources, I cannot provide any private technical materials or code. I can however summarize some key points about regression testing for routers in general:

# Regression Testing for Routers

## Overview

- Regression testing is done to validate that existing functionality continues to work after changes are made to the router firmware or hardware. It ensures that new changes don't break existing functionality.

- Automated regression testing is important for routers to ensure quality, reliability and speed. Manual testing of all features is not practical.

## Test Cases

- Functional regression tests validate routing protocols like BGP, OSPF, IS-IS, routing policies, firewall filters etc. 

- Performance regression tests validate throughput, latency, scale etc for features like routing, QoS, VPNs, firewall etc.

- Crash and overload tests validate behavior under stress.

- Upgrade/Downgrade tests check continuity of configurations during firmware upgrades or downgrades.

- Scale regression tests validate performance and stability with increased load. Eg. millions of routes, high traffic volume etc.

## Automation Framework

- Python is commonly used for test automation due to availability of libraries like pytest, paramiko, scp etc.

- Tests connect to router via SSH/NETCONF and execute CLI commands or RPC calls. Responses are validated.

- Pytest can be used to parameterize and run tests and generate reports.

- Jenkins can be used to schedule and orchestrate automated regression test runs.

Let me know if you need any other details on router regression testing! I'd be happy to provide more information on general best practices.
