# Python Regression Test for MX480

## Introduction
In this test, we will perform a regression analysis on the MX480 using Python.

### Data Collection
First, we need to collect the necessary data for our regression analysis. This may include historical data on performance metrics, configurations, and network traffic.

```python
# Collecting data
import pandas as pd

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv('mx480_data.csv')

# Display sample data
print(data.head())
```

## Data Preprocessing
Next, we will preprocess the data by removing any outliers, normalizing the data, and handling missing values.

```python
# Data preprocessing
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer

# Remove outliers
data = data[(data['performance_metric'] > 0) & (data['network_traffic'] > 0)]

# Normalize data
scaler = StandardScaler()
scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(data[['performance_metric', 'network_traffic']])

# Handle missing values
imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='mean')
imputed_data = imputer.fit_transform(scaled_data)
```

## Regression Analysis
Now, we will perform the regression analysis using the preprocessed data.

```python
# Regression analysis
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(imputed_data, data['configuration'], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```

## Evaluation
Finally, we will evaluate the performance of our regression model.

```python
# Model evaluation
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Calculate mean squared error
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions)

# Display results
print('Mean Squared Error:', mse)
```

## Conclusion
In this regression test, we analyzed the MX480 data, preprocessed it, performed regression analysis, and evaluated the model's performance. The mean squared error gives us an indication of how well our model fits the data.

# Regression Test for MX480 Router Configuration

## Overview
The purpose of this regression test is to run a detailed test on the MX480 router to ensure that the configuration settings are correct and functioning as expected.

## Test Scenarios
1. Verify the interface configuration
2. Check the BGP configuration
3. Test the OSPF configuration
4. Validate the firewall settings

## Test Steps

### 1. Interface Configuration
- Use the `show interfaces` command to display the status and configuration of all interfaces.
```bash
router# show interfaces
```

### 2. BGP Configuration
- Verify the BGP neighbors and their status using the `show bgp summary` command.
```bash
router# show bgp summary
```

### 3. OSPF Configuration
- Ensure that the OSPF adjacency is formed and functioning properly. Use the `show ospf neighbor` and `show ospf interface` commands.
```bash
router# show ospf neighbor
router# show ospf interface
```

### 4. Firewall Settings
- Validate the firewall policies and rules using the `show firewall` command.
```bash
router# show firewall
```

## Expected Results
- All interfaces should be in the up/up state with the correct configuration.
- BGP neighbors should be established and active.
- OSPF adjacency should be formed and interfaces should be participating in OSPF.
- Firewall policies and rules should be displayed with their respective configurations.

## Conclusion
Upon completion of the regression test, if all the observed results match the expected results, the MX480 router configuration can be considered accurate and functioning properly.
