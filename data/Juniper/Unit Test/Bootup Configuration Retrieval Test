This script is designated for a unit test involving the Juniper MX240 router to verify retrieval of VLAN configurations at boot. Modify the IP and login credentials accordingly. The presence of specific VLAN data in the config retrieval confirms successful load during startup. Ensure all dependency packages are installed using the provided `pip install` commands before running this script. Adjust script details such as VLAN identifiers or other conditions matching your test environment's setup.
