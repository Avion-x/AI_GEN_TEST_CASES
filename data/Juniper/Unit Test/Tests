###ENDLIST###

The test cases cover validating port blocking on security violation and port re-enabling after err-disabled timeout. The test scripts leverage the Junos PyEZ library to connect to the Juniper device, configure port security, trigger violations, check status and verify expected behavior. The scripts are structured based on your requirements with all the necessary fields included. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional requirements to cover.
