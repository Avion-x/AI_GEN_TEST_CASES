###ENDLIST###

These scripts are set to perform critical validation checks such as retrieving configurations from storage and ensuring all essential hardware components initialize properly without issues. Each `testscript` object contains a Python script formatted for automation with `paramiko` for SSH operations, and assertions to verify that the systems behave as expected. This format ensures that you can accurately track test names, objectives, executable files, necessary initialization commands, and expected results for comprehensive testing.
