# UNIT TEST cases for the Network MSeries Router MX480

## Test Case 1: Basic Connectivity

### Description:
This test case checks whether the router can establish basic connectivity with other devices in the network.

### Test Steps:
1. Connect the router to a known working network.
2. Ping a few devices within the network.
3. Verify that the router can successfully communicate with the devices.

### Expected Result:
All ping tests should pass without any packet loss.

## Test Case 2: Interface Configuration

### Description:
This test case verifies the configuration of the router's interfaces.

### Test Steps:
1. Configure a new interface on the router.
2. Assign an IP address and subnet mask to the interface.
3. Verify the interface status and configuration.

### Expected Result:
The new interface should be up and its configuration should match the assigned parameters.

## Test Case 3: Routing Protocols

### Description:
This test case checks the functionality of routing protocols on the router.

### Test Steps:
1. Enable a routing protocol (e.g., OSPF) on the router.
2. Advertise networks and establish neighbor relationships.
3. Verify the routing table for learned routes.

### Expected Result:
The router should successfully participate in the routing protocol and populate its routing table with the correct learned routes.
