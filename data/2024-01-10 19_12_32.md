# UNIT TEST CASES for Network MSeries Router MX480

## Test Case 1: Connectivity
### Description
Verify that the router is able to establish a connection with multiple devices simultaneously.

### Steps
1. Connect multiple devices (e.g. laptops, smartphones) to the router.
2. Verify that each device is able to establish a stable connection and access the network.

### Expected Output
All connected devices should be able to access the network without any connectivity issues.

## Test Case 2: Routing and Packet Forwarding
### Description
Verify that the router is able to appropriately route and forward packets between different networks.

### Steps
1. Send packets from a device in one network to a device in another network.
2. Monitor the router's routing and packet forwarding functionality.

### Expected Output
The router should correctly route and forward packets between the different networks without any loss or errors.

```bash
traceroute <destination IP>
```

## Test Case 3: Quality of Service (QoS)
### Description
Verify that the router is able to prioritize traffic based on QoS rules.

### Steps
1. Send different types of traffic (e.g. voice, video, data) through the router.
2. Apply QoS rules to prioritize specific types of traffic.
3. Monitor the traffic and QoS priority.

### Expected Output
The router should correctly prioritize traffic based on the QoS rules applied, ensuring that higher priority traffic is given precedence.

```bash
show qos policies
```

## Test Case 4: Failover and Redundancy
### Description
Verify that the router is able to handle failover and maintain network connectivity in case of a link or hardware failure.

### Steps
1. Simulate a link or hardware failure by disconnecting a port or component.
2. Monitor the router's response and failover process.

### Expected Output
The router should seamlessly transition to redundant links or hardware components, maintaining network connectivity without any interruption.

```bash
show system redundancy
```

These are some examples of unit test cases for the Network MSeries Router MX480, covering different aspects such as connectivity, routing, QoS, and failover. Each test case includes a clear description, steps, expected output, and relevant command line snippets for verification.
